<p class='c011'>There are some methods explained in this book which
the author does not endorse. They are printed because
they are necessary to a thorough understanding of the
subject. Newspapers publish reports of murders, but
this does not imply endorsement of the crimes.</p>

<p class='c012'>Aside from these features there are many things which
the practicing physician may read and follow to his advantage.
The introductory chapter by Dr. Lydston will
be found to be of special interest.</p>

</div>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c005'>
    <div><span class='large'>By G. Frank Lydston, M.D.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>As a general proposition it is safe to assert that the
practice of medicine from a business standpoint is a failure.
The successful exceptions merely prove the rule. It
is also safe to assume that the elements of financial non-success
are cumulative in their action—a fact that is easily
proved by hospital and dispensary statistics.</p>

<p class='c012'>The practitioner of medicine, like every man who relies
on his own hand and brain for a livelihood, is entitled to a
bit of earth that he and his may call their own, at least a
modest competence, and a well-earned rest when his sun
begins to set and the twilight of his life approaches. How
many doctors are in a position to enjoy or even render
less awesome their twilight days? As city doctors are all
supposed to be rich—at least by the public, that does all
it can to prevent their becoming so—it would be interesting
to know what proportion of them, even in metropolitan
medical centers, own their own homes or have property
investments. A far smaller proportion than is just,
I fancy.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>The assertion has been made that the general poverty
of the medical profession is due to a lack of appreciation
and a contempt for the rights of the medical man on the
part of the public at large. This, however, is a secondary
matter which, being self-evident, overshadows the primary
cause—the asinine stupidity of the profession itself.
As a broad, general proposition the reputable profession
as a whole has about as much sense as the dodo, and, unless
signs fail, will, sooner or later, meet the fate of that
remarkable bird. How the profession can expect the respect
and appreciation of the public when it has no
respect or appreciation for itself is difficult to conjecture.
The public cannot be expected to keep clean the nest
of the medical dodo. Furthermore, the public quite
rationally values the stupid thing according to its self-appraisement.</p>

<p class='c012'>Primarily, the practice of medicine is supposed to be
founded on a mawkish, blanket-like sentiment of philanthropy,
which is expected to cover both God’s and the
devil’s patients—the pauper and the dead-beat—the honest
man and the rascal—the rich and poor alike. The doctor
is expected to wallow eye-deep in the milk of human
kindness, scattering it broadcast for the benefit of humanity,
but he is in no wise expected to even absorb a little
of it, much less to swallow a gulp or two occasionally for
his own benefit. By way of piling Pelion upon Ossa, the
public, having discovered that the doctor sets little value
on his own services, proceeds to eye him with suspicion;
the tradesman is very careful how he trusts doctors. Of
course the tradesman has his own family physician
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>“hung up” for a goodly sum, but—knowing doctors to be
poor business men—the tradesman often cheats them in
both the quality and price of goods.</p>

<p class='c012'>It is a great and goodly game that plays from both
ends and catches the victim in the middle. The tradesman
has one redeeming feature, however; he does his
best to teach his doctor patrons a lesson. He either sends
his goods C.O.D., or, if the doctor be one of the favored
ones, he finds the bill in his mail bright and early on the
first of the month. I often think my tradesmen must sit
up all night in order to get their bills in bright and early
on the first. If not paid by the 15th, a collector is usually
at the doctor’s office to see about it.</p>

<p class='c012'>Yet the professional dodo—my apologies to the shade
of the “sure enough” dodo—will not learn. He goes on
and on, neglecting his accounts, mainly because he is
afraid of offending his patrons and driving them off to
some other doctor who isn’t so particular; and the worst
of it is, there are plenty of contemptible fellows who draw
their own salaries promptly when due, or present their
bills for goods with frantic haste, who consider a doctor’s
bill a flagrant insult. Will nothing ever inspire the doctor
with courage enough to despise and ignore such contemptible
trash? Does he prefer the role of a lickspittle
to that of an independent and self-reliant man?</p>

<p class='c012'>As illustrations of the value the profession sets on its
skill and learning, the amount of gratuitous work done is
striking. Our pauper—or pauperized—patrons are divided
into several classes, viz.: 1. The free hospital, clinic and
dispensary class. This is on the increase. According to
Dr. Frederick Holme Wiggin, 51 per cent of all cases of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>sickness in New York City are now classed medically as
paupers, as against 1.5 per cent twenty years ago! This
is appalling. Of these alleged paupers it is safe to say
that 75 per cent are able to pay full or at least fairly good
fees. Why should pauperism be shown so prominently in
the matter of medical bills, as compared with other necessities
of life? And why should the profession carry a
burden that belongs to the public? 2. Free patients of
the private class: (a) those who can pay but will not, <i>i.e.</i>,
dead beats, and swindlers; (b) persons whose circumstances
are such that the doctor feels in duty bound to
render no bills; (c) persons who presume upon social
acquaintance with the doctor to “hold him up” for
friendly, perhaps informal, consultations.</p>

<p class='c012'>It requires no great mental effort to see the terrible load
the profession is carrying—self-inflicted, and often for
fallaciously selfish motives, it is true, but none the less
heavy. The college and free hospital may be the professional
“old man of the sea,” but so much the worse for the
medical Sinbad. Whatever the explanation, private practice
is on a par with dispensary practice with regard to
the impositions practiced on the doctor. It is safe to say
that, of the sum total of surgical and medical patients of
all kinds and social conditions under treatment in Chicago
at the present time, over one-half are paupers—honest or
dishonest. Pay the doctor for the work involved in this
wasted and misapplied charity, and the medical profession
would plunge into a sea of prosperity that might swamp
it. And it is not only the rank and file of the profession
that suffers. Ye celebrated professor, reaching out for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>glory, yea, into infinite space, clutching frantically at
everything in sight, no matter how profitless—providing
the other fellow doesn’t get the case—often defeats his
own ends. And the great man dies, and is buried, and we
take up a collection for his widow, to meet his funeral expenses,
and sell his library—six feet of earth make all
men of a size. <i>Sic transit gloria mundi.</i></p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>And when, like dog, he’s had his day,</div>
      <div class='line'>And his poor soul hath passed away,</div>
      <div class='line'>Some friendly scribe in tearful mood</div>
      <div class='line'>Will tell the world how very good</div>
      <div class='line'>The dear departed doctor was—</div>
      <div class='line'>And thus win for himself applause.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>One of the most potent causes of professional poverty
is the mania of the doctor for a pretense of well-doing.
He exhibits this in many ways. One of the most pernicious
is an affectation of contempt for money. This it
is that often impels him to delay the rendering of his
accounts. Oftentimes his patient offers to pay all or part
of his bill. With a lordly and opulent wave of his marasmic
hand the doctor says, “Oh, that’s all right; any time’ll
do.” And the triple-plated medical imbecile goes on his
way with a dignified strut that ill befits the aching void in
his epigastric region, and is decidedly out of harmony
with the befringed extremities of his trousers. And then
the doctor apologizes to himself on the ground of a philanthropy
that is but the rankest and most asinine egotism
<i>en masque</i>.</p>

<p class='c012'>When will the doctor understand that payment deferred
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>maketh the patient dishonest? When will he consider the
necessities of his wife and children as outweighing the
feelings of the patient who owes him money? When will
he be a man, and not a time-server and truckler to appearances?
He would take the money did he not fear the patient
might suspect that his doctor was not prosperous.
He wishes the patient to think that the doctor and his
family dine with the chameleons, or are fed by ravens.
Yet the medical Elijah waiteth in vain for the manna-bearing
birds—they know him for what he is, a counterfeit
prophet who vainly yearns for the flesh-pots of Egypt—who
has a ponderous and all-consuming desire for pabulum,
and a microcephalic capacity for finance.</p>

<p class='c012'>Doctors are supposed to be keen judges of human nature.
I often think this is absolutely without foundation.
Defective knowledge in this direction is a very expensive
luxury to the medical profession. The confidence man
and sharper cannot fool the average doctor into buying a
gold brick, perhaps, but they can come very near it. The
oily-tongued and plausible man with a scheme finds the
doctor his easiest prey. The doctor has often hard enough
work to wring a few dollars out of his field of labor, and it
might be supposed that it would be difficult to get those
dollars away from him, but no, it’s only too easy. He bites
at everything that comes along—he often rises to a bare
hook. Mining stocks, irrigation and colonization schemes,
expensive books that he doesn’t want, will never need and
couldn’t find time to read if he would, histories of his town
or state in which his biography and picture will appear
for $100—proprietary medicine schemes, stock in publications
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>of various kinds; he bites at everything going—he
has <i>embonpoint cerebrale</i>. Oh, but the doctor is easy! I
have very painful memories. The best investment I ever
made was when I paid a fellow for painting a sign for the
door of my consultation room, reading: “Notice—Persons
with schemes will please keep out. I have some of my
own to promote.”</p>

<p class='c012'>It is rather a delicate matter, perhaps, for a college professor
to touch on the evils of medical colleges in their
relation to the business aspect of medicine, but I shall
nevertheless speak plainly and to the point. While theoretically
the better class of medical colleges were founded
solely for the advancement of science, it is none the less
true that self-aggrandizement has been the pedestal on
which most of our disinterested giants in the teaching
arena have stood and are standing. Remove the personal
selfish interest of college teachers and most of our schools
would be compelled to close for lack of instructors. Let
us be honest with ourselves, please. Not that self-interest
is reprehensible—I hold the contrary. One may teach for
salary, reputation, the love of teaching, or a desire for self-improvement,
it matters not, for if he be of the proper
timber he is the right man in the right place. Self-interest
makes better teachers on the average than philanthropy,
providing the primal material is good.</p>

<p class='c012'>Granting that self-interest is the mainspring of the college
professor, is he very “long-headed” from a business
standpoint? I submit the following propositions as proving
that the average college professor defeats his own
ends.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>1. He devotes to teaching, time and labor over and
above the exigencies of ordinary practice, which, if devoted
to cultivating the good-will of the laity, would be
much more profitable.</p>

<p class='c012'>2. While cultivating the acquaintance and friendship of
the alumni of his own school—a few each year—he alienates
from himself the friendship of every alumnus of
every rival school, the instant he begins teaching.</p>

<p class='c012'>3. He assists in educating and starting in life young,
active competitors to himself.</p>

<p class='c012'>4. He is unreasonably expected to devote a large percentage
of his time to the gratuitous relief of medical
students and physicians. He may give his time cheerfully,
but he yields up his nerve force just the same.</p>

<p class='c012'>5. Most college professors are less successful in the
long run than the more fortunate ones of the rank and file
who have never aspired to teaching honors.</p>

<p class='c012'>6. Greater demands are made on a professor’s purse
than if he were in the non-teaching ranks of medicine.
He, more than all others, is expected to put up a prosperous
appearance.</p>

<p class='c012'>The college clinic—especially of the surgical sort—is
far-reaching in its detrimental effects on professional prosperity.
Few or no questions are asked, and the millionaire
is being operated on daily, side by side with the pauper,
free. And the blame does not always lie with the professor
who runs the clinic. General practitioners bring
patients to the free clinics every day, with full cognizance
of their ability to pay well. Why doctors will persist in
thus cheapening surgical art is difficult to conjecture—but
they do it just the same.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>Of course, the college clinic is supposed to be a theater
of instruction. Often, however, it is but a stage on which
comedy-dramas are enacted. A brilliant operation that
nobody six feet away can see, and an operator bellowing
at his audience like the traditional bull of Basham—in
medical terms that confuse but do not enlighten, terms
that are Greek to most of the listeners—this is the little
comedy-drama that is enacted for students who have eyes
but see not; who have ears but hear not. Instruction?
Bah! Take the theatric elements and the plays to the
gallery out of some college clinics and there wouldn’t be a
corporal’s guard in attendance.</p>

<p class='c012'>Worse than the free clinics are the so-called charitable
hospitals. Much has been said of dispensary abuses, but
few have had the courage to say anything in adverse
criticism of these institutions. While nominally founded
to fill “a long-felt want”—and the number of long-felt
wants, from the hospital standpoint, is legion—these hospitals
are founded on strictly business principles, save in
this respect—the people who found them feed on their
innate capacity to get something for nothing. The first
thing the founders do is to get a staff of doctors to pull the
hospital chestnuts out of the fire. The members of the
staff think that the hospital is performing the same duty
for them, and everything is serene. And so the surgeon
goes on operating on twenty patients—fifteen of whom are
able to pay him a fee—in the hope that one among them
all is <i>willing</i> to pay him a fee.</p>

<p class='c012'>Exaggeration? Well, I cannot swear to the accuracy
of the foregoing, but an eastern surgeon of world-wide
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>fame once told me that for every patient who paid him a
fee he operated on nineteen for nothing; and this man has
no public clinic, either. Is it conceivable that the nineteen
free patients are all paupers? Many of them go to
my friend for operation from very long distances. Ought
the railroads and hospitals to have all the profits? Have
we not all had similar experiences in a lesser degree? With
the development of charitable hospitals far in excess of
any legitimate demand, it has come to pass that surgery is
almost a thing unknown in general city practice. Even
the minor operations have left the general practitioner—to
return no more so long as there are free hospitals and
dispensaries. Where is the emergency surgery, of which,
in former days, every practitioner had his share? Railroaded
off to the “charity” hospitals to be cared for gratis.</p>

<p class='c012'>In a recent conversation with a practitioner of thirty
years’ experience, I said, “Doctor, you used to do a great
deal of general surgery throughout this section of the city.
Have the hospitals affected your practice in that direction
to any extent?” He replied, “Surgery with me is a thing
of the past. Even emergency cases are carted off to the
nearest hospital. If by chance one does fall into my hands,
it is taken away from me as soon as I have done the ‘first-aid’
work.” Personally, I see very little use in teaching
surgery to the majority of students who intend to practice
in our large cities—they will have little use for surgical
knowledge.</p>

<p class='c012'>Here are three cases in illustration of the way our “charitable”
hospitals antagonize the business interests of the
profession:</p>

<p class='c012'>1.—A very wealthy farmer engaged me to perform an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>exceedingly important operation. It was understood that
$1,000 was to be the honorarium. He was afterwards advised
to go to a certain “religious” hospital, where he was
operated on by an eminent surgeon, who received nothing
for his services. The patient paid $15 a week for hospital
accommodation, and $25 a day to his family physician,
who remained with him “for company.” What a harmonious
understanding between the patient and his family
doctor—and what a “soft mark” that surgeon was. I had
the pleasure of telling the latter of the gold mine he didn’t
find, some time later, and the shock to his system amply
revenged the body surgical.</p>

<p class='c012'>2.—A patient who was under my care for some weeks
and paid me an excellent fee finally divulged the fact that
he had meanwhile been living at a certain hospital as an
“out patient,” at an expense of $8 a week. He had become
dissatisfied with the hospital attention, he said, and, pretending
great improvement, was permitted to get about
out-of-doors.</p>

<p class='c012'>3.—A man on whom I operated and who paid me my
full fee without argument or question, came to me directly
from one of our large hospitals, where he had been sojourning
for several months.</p>

<p class='c012'>That medical men in hospitals are imposed on is a trite
observation. So long, however, as it appears to be the doctor’s
advantage to be on a hospital staff, plenty of men will
be found who will be glad of the chance. As for the injury
which the system inflicts on the profession at large, that is
no argument with the individual. Human nature operates
here as elsewhere. Knowing that the system is bad, we
are all anxious to become victims.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>In recommending the payment of salaries to hospital
men, the Cleveland <i>Medical Journal</i> claimed that such a
plan will remedy all the evils incident to the professional
side of hospital management. I do not agree in the opinion
that the payment of salaries to the staffs of institutions
for the care of the sick will alone correct the evils of such
institutions. The writer of the aforesaid editorial is incorrect,
also, when he says that an awakening is at hand. No,
not at hand; it is coming, though; the handwriting is on
the wall. When the revolution does come, this is what
will happen:</p>

<p class='c012'>1.—Hospital physicians and surgeons will be paid
salaries.</p>

<p class='c012'>2.—Hospitals will take as free patients or patients who
pay the hospital alone only such persons as rigid investigation
has shown to be indigent. All others will be compelled
to pay their medical attendants, just as in private
practice.</p>

<p class='c012'>3.—Certificates of indigency will be required of every
free patient, such certificate being signed by the patient’s
attending physician—outside of the hospital—and at least
two other persons in the community where he or she
resides.</p>

<p class='c012'>4.—General, and especially country, practitioners will
cease to deceive hospital doctors as to the circumstances
of their patients. One medical man should not impose
on another.</p>

<p class='c012'>Too much trouble, eh? Well, my friends of the hospital
and dispensary—for the same charges should apply to the
latter—you must either take your medicine or the revolution
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>will go farther and this is what will happen: The
profession at large will boycott every man who runs a college
clinic, and every hospital and dispensary man. It will
fight colleges and hospitals to the bitter end.</p>

<p class='c012'>The day is perhaps not far distant when doctors outside
of colleges and hospitals will run their private practices
on the co-operative plan, thus dealing a death blow to
the free clinic and dispensary. Every man of prominence
will have his own private clinic and advertise it among his
patients. What is fair for twenty or thirty men is fair and
ethical for one. Each man can have his own hours for the
poor; he can eliminate the unworthy ones, and, best of all,
he can refer all his dead-beat patients to his clinic. Pride
may bring fees from patients to whom honesty is a thing
unknown. The private hospital will run most of the public
hospitals off the earth. There will be no room for anything
but municipal hospitals run squarely and fairly for
charity, and reputable private hospitals run frankly for
pecuniary profit, in which the operation and the attendance
fees are the chief factors. Such hospitals will benefit,
not hurt, the profession.</p>

<p class='c012'>One of the most vital flaws in the business sense of the
general practitioner is his penchant for hero worship. He
hears of the medical tin god from afar, and burns incense
on the altar of his greatness. The great man pats the humble
doctor on the back, calls him a good boy, and tells him
just where to take all his cases. Sometimes he offers to
divide fees with him.</p>

<p class='c012'>The medical tin god is truly a “self-made man in love
with his maker.” He has “genius stamped upon his brow—writ
there by himself.” His evolution is interesting. It is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>history repeating itself: Apsethus the Libyan wished to
become a god. Despairing of doing so, he did the next
best thing—he made people believe he was a god. He captured
a large number of parrots in the Libyan forests and
confined them in cages. Day after day he taught them to
repeat, “Apsethus the Libyan is a god,” over and over
again. The parrots’ lesson learned, Apsethus set them
free. They flew far away, even into Greece. And people
coming to view the strange birds, heard them say, “Apsethus
the Libyan is a god; Apsethus the Libyan is a god.”
And the people cried, “Apsethus the Libyan is a god; let
us worship Apsethus the Libyan.” Thus was founded the
first post-graduate school.</p>

<p class='c012'>The medical Apsethus and the deluded parrots of the
medical rank and file are here, and here to stay, until both
are starved out. And the modest general practitioner
looks up to the medical tin god and wonders “upon what
meat does this our Cæsar feed that he hath grown so
great?” The meat of industry? Perhaps. The meat of
prodigious cerebral development? Seldom. The meat
of opportunity? Yea, yea, my struggling brother, “and
the devil take the hindmost.” But, more than all, he
hath fed on the meat that the parrots have brought him—Elijah’s
ravens were not a circumstance to those parrots.
“In the kingdom of the blind the one-eyed man is king.”</p>

<p class='c012'>How long will the general practitioner continue to play
parrot to the medical tin god of the charitable hospital
the very existence of which is a menace to the best interests
of the profession—the profession for which the institution
has no charity? In that happy time to be there
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>will be no tin gods. There will be a more equable division
of work and every prosperous community will have its
up-to-date private hospitals with up-to-date men at the
head of them.</p>

<p class='c012'>As for the post-graduate teacher—good or bad—he is
already defeating his own ends—he is exciting ambitions
in the breasts of his pupils. Here and there among them
is an embryo McDowell, a Sims, or a Battey. The backwoods
country produces good, rich blood and virile
brains. And the Sims, and McDowells, and Batteys of
the future will be found in relatively small places, doing
good work, and then—good-bye to the tin god and his
horn, “for whosoever bloweth not his own horn, the same
shall not be blown.” And in that day the parrot shall
evolve into an eagle, and the hawk had better have an eye
to windward. Meanwhile, hurrah for the post-graduate
school and its pupils, and more power to the tin gods.</p>

<p class='c012'>This business handicap is so self-evident that it is
hardly necessary to touch on it. We raise the standard of
medical education year by year, yet the mushroom colleges
do not go—they are here to stay. If one-half the colleges
were wiped out of existence there would still be more
than enough to supply the demand for physicians. We
have done the best we could to breed competition by
manufacturing doctors, and we are doing all we can to
make that competition first class—a queer business proposition
in force of the oversupply of doctors. We are
unjust, too, to the men we educate, by offering them inducements
to enter an already overcrowded profession—but
so long as human nature is as it is I see no way out
of the dilemma.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>There was once a time when it appeared a goodly thing
for the chosen few to get together like the “three tailors
of Tooley street,” and, after establishing to their own
satisfaction the fact that they were indeed “the people,”
formulated rules for the guidance of the many. These
rules were called “ethics.” And the profession has been
wrestling with its ethics ever since, trying to determine
what it was all about anyhow. The ethical garment of
half a century ago no longer fits—it is frayed and fringed,
and baggy at the knees; full many a patch has been
sewed on it, in individual attempts to make it fit from
year to year, until it is now, like the Irishman’s hat, respectable
by age and sentimental association only. And
the public, the ever practical and heartless public, has
also wondered what ’twas all about, and exhibits little
sympathy for a profession which, while driveling of
ethics, has “strained at gnats and swallowed camels.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Who does not remember when all the wiseacres with
number eighteen collars and number five hats seriously
discussed the relative propriety of “Specialty” vs. “Practice
Limited,” on professional cards? How times have
changed. And then came the discussion by a learned society,
of the ethical relations of “Oculist and Aurist” to
“Practice Limited to Diseases of the Eye and Ear.” And
it was decided that men who had the former on their
cards were not ethical and could not enter that society.
Ye Gods! Is the fool-killer always on a vacation? Must
we always see those long ears waving over the top of the
ethical fence, built by the fat hogs to keep all the little
pigs out of the clover patch? What is the public to think
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>of a profession that winks its other eye at the man who
prints on his cards, “Diseases of Women Only,” but rolls
up it eyes like a dying rabbit at the sight of a card reading,
“Diseases of Men Only?” What has raised the
woman with leucorrhea to a more exalted plane than that
occupied by a man with prostatorrhea, does not appear.
Why so many inconsistencies, and why such hypocrisy!</p>

<p class='c012'>Sir Astley Cooper had his own private “hours for the
poor.” Our European brethren print their college and
hospital positions and all their titles on their cards. Are
they less ethical than we? Homeopathy is a dead duck
over there, and quackery has a hard row to hoe in Europe—queer,
isn’t it?</p>

<p class='c012'>Our system of ethics has not only been hypocritic, but
somewhat confusing. The young man on the threshold
of medicine doesn’t know “where he is at.” He is confronted
by the unwritten law that only celebrated men
and quacks may advertise. Small fry, who haven’t the
ear of the newspapers nor a chance for a college position,
are tacitly ordered to keep their hands off. And the young
fellow watches the career of the big man, who hides every
other man’s light under his own bushel, and marvels
much. Especially does he marvel at the accurate photographs,
life histories and clinical reports of his more fortunate
confrères that appear in the newspapers without
their knowledge.</p>

<p class='c012'>Experiences differ. I haven’t yet got around to newspaper
clinical reports, but it has been my fortune to be
“written up” on several occasions. I do not recall that
the newspapers drew on their imaginations for my photograph.
I wish I might think so, and that their imaginations
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>were distorted—the result was so uncomplimentary.</p>

<p class='c012'>So far as I can learn, nobody protests against being
legitimately represented in the newspapers. Why not be
honest about it? The hypocrisy of some men is sickening.
Paying clandestinely for newspaper write-ups is despicable,
yet some of the very men who protest that they
“really don’t see how that could have gotten into the
papers,” have paid for the advertising in good “coin of
the realm.” It is queer that the newspapers should write
up the most minute details of the wonderful exploits of
some poor fellows, together with their family histories,
and publish their photographs, without their knowledge
or consent—especially queer when we read in conclusion
that “Professor John Doe is the greatest surgeon that
ever lived.” Why not come out and acknowledge that
these are paid for? This would give an equal chance to
all, and especially to young fellows who have money
enough to pay for similar things. He who has not the
price should not find fault with the fellow who has, for,
“business is business.” Meanwhile, my young friends, remember
that “big mountains may do what little mountains
may not do.”</p>

<p class='c012'>When Koch’s tuberculin was yet new, soon after it escaped,
half-fledged from the laboratory, only to be captured
and made to perform like a trick monkey for the
benefit of the laity, there came a ring at the phone of a
prominent daily paper: “Hello, is this the <i>Daily Bazoo</i>?”
“Huh, huh, it are.” “Well, I’m Dr. Squirtem Galls. I
wish you would send a reporter over here at once. I
want to be interviewed on Koch’s tuberculin.” It is said
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>that $25 changed hands, but I don’t believe it. The gentleman
would never advertise—at that rate—“no sir-ree.”
My informant was once the sporting editor of the <i>War
Cry</i>, and hence unworthy of credence.</p>

<p class='c012'>And what wonderful contributions the newspaper-great-men
are making to science! The daily paper is the
place to study appendicitis and things. It is not long
since I learned from a distinguished surgeon friend of
mine, via a daily paper, that evidence of a blow having
been received on the head is an imperative indication for
craniectomy, whether symptoms are present or not.</p>

<p class='c012'>In preference to the clandestine methods now in vogue,
would it not be better for men in authority to write signed
articles for the newspapers and intelligently present medical
matter to the public? But that wouldn’t be ethical,
would it? Such topics as “Advice to Young Men,” “Letters
to Young Wives” and “How to Keep Healthy,” must
be left to the quacks. We will confine ourselves to the
surreptitious blowing of surgical horns and never mind
the false notes.</p>

<p class='c012'>Meanwhile, let us stand back and watch the procession
of modest men who never advertise—oh, no! At the
head, with haughty mien, comes Professor Keene Carver,
preceded by a herald in blood-red garb, blowing a large
brass horn. Then comes the “bearded lady,” whose
blonde and breezy whiskers so delight the heart of his
swell society <i>clientele</i>. And here comes Rip Van Winkle—a
middle-of-the-road “eclectic,” gathering up his long
and weedy beard to keep it from getting tangled up in the
scientific barbed wire fence along the route. And here
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>comes another sure-enough “regular,” evidently a medicine
man—so rare nowadays. He is riding in a swell
turnout and is on his way to his clinic. How do I know
that Professor Windy Bowels is a regular? Because the
gentleman who is riding beside him to his clinic is a reporter
on the Chicago <i>Daily Jib-boom</i>.</p>

<p class='c012'>I presume that the suggestion that I have made of the
advisability of taking the public frankly into our confidence
and giving it accurate information so far as its comprehension
goes, by signed articles, in preference to clandestine
advertising and the promulgation of fallacious
ideas of medicine and surgery, will meet with bitter opposition.
I nevertheless believe that a better education of
the public is the only way to down quackery. The opposition
will come chiefly from the surreptitious advertiser,
who sees a prospect of other men getting the advertisement
that he believes to be his proprietary right.</p>

<p class='c012'>Then there is the tribe of the Microcephali. The howl
of protest will be long and loud from the pews occupied by
these far-famed champions of medical orthodoxy. “We
won’t put <i>our</i> discoveries or contributions in the newspapers—not
ever.” And gazing at their lemur-like front
elevations, we can well believe that they would have
no trouble in establishing a “halibi.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Apropos of “discoveries,” it may as well be understood
that the public is bound to get the details of them sooner
or later, and, when the time is ripe, the matter should be
presented to it in a clear and intelligible form—comprehensible
to the layman.</p>

  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER II<br /> <br /><b>THE PHYSICIAN WHO SUCCEEDS</b></h2>
</div>
<p class='c011'>To a great extent Nature has a commanding influence
in the equipment of the successful practicing physician,—the
man who actually secures the desired results in his
treatment of patients, builds up and retains a good practice,
and obtains a financial income of respectable proportions.</p>

<p class='c012'>Any man of ability, with the necessary education and
training, may obtain a certain amount of success as a
physician and make a modest income—or drag out a miserable
existence; this latter is the most probable. It is a
well-established fact that the great majority of physicians
are not what the world would call prosperous. This
is not because they do not earn enough to secure a competence,
but because they do not get it.</p>

<p class='c012'>The doctor’s bill is almost invariably the last one paid.
His practice is generally among the middle classes, people
whose intentions are good, but whose incomes are
limited. If there is anything left after the rent, and grocery
and butcher and other bills are paid the doctor will,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>perhaps, get something on account, but as a rule he
doesn’t.</p>

<p class='c012'>This is mainly owing to the fact that the average physician
is a poor business man; he does not place an adequate
value on his services, and is slack in looking after
collections. If pressed by his wife, or some friend, to be
more particular in this respect, his almost invariable reply
will be:</p>

<p class='c012'>“It would not look well for me to put myself on the
same plane with merchants. Mine is a profession, not a
trade. Besides, I’m in duty bound to do a certain amount
of charity work.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Now charity work is all right in its place. An honest,
upright practitioner will never refuse to respond to a call
for his services in deserving cases because the payment of
his fee is uncertain, but this does not obtain to the extent
of virtually making paupers of people who are actually
able to pay. And yet this is really what happens when a
physician conducts his business affairs in a slipshod manner,
and this is what most of them do. There is no excuse
or reason for it.</p>

<p class='c012'>But we started in to tell of Nature’s part in the equipment
of the successful physician. What is the equipment?
The possession of a robust, healthy physique, a
sunny, cheerful disposition, and a fair knowledge of medicine,
and ordinary business ability. All are essential if
real success is to be attained, either in a medical sense, or
in the accumulation of a respectable income.</p>

<p class='c012'>Let us take two instances for the purpose of comparison.
In one case we have a practitioner with just a fair
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>knowledge of medicine, but in the possession of all the
characteristics mentioned. His very presence in the sick
chamber acts as a tonic to the patient.</p>

<p class='c012'>Then we have a thin, undersized, nervous, dyspeptic
physician; dissatisfied with himself and the world generally.
He is a thorough master in medicine, and his treatment
is more scientific than that of his less learned
brother. His presence in the sick chamber, however, has
anything but a soothing effect on the patient. On the contrary
it irritates him, and the effect of the scientific treatment
is nullified. This is not an exaggerated case. There
are thousands of just such men in practice.</p>

<p class='c012'>Which practitioner is going to have the greatest meed
of success? The answer is easy—the one who cheers and
encourages his patient by the magnetism of his presence.</p>

<p class='c012'>Talk as we may, suggestion is a powerful factor in the
practice of medicine. I do not mean by this that suggestion
alone will cure illness (this statement is made without
intention of affronting those who believe in Christian
Science). But there is ample evidence to the effect that
suggestion goes a long ways in making medical treatment
effective. It is only the physician whom Nature has
equipped in the manner indicated who can offer the right
kind of suggestion and he does it unconsciously.</p>

<p class='c012'>A physician of this kind is bound to become popular,
and popularity begets a large practice and commensurate
fees, provided the practitioner is in the right location, and
has the business acumen to place the proper value on his
services.</p>

<p class='c012'>From time immemorial physicians have been imbued
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>with the idea that they must adhere to a set scale of fees.
I am speaking now of the average doctor, the man with a
general practice. All patients, the laborer and the banker,
the wage earner and the millionaire, are charged the same.
In the country districts, the small towns and cities, this
charge is usually one dollar a visit. In the larger places it
is generally two dollars.</p>

<p class='c012'>Why should this be so? The architect, the attorney,
the civil engineer are all professional men in the same
way that the physician is. Whoever heard of any of them
adhering to a set scale of fees in the same way that doctors
do? Invariably they regulate the charge for their
services according to the money value involved, and the
nature of the services required. The man who employs
an attorney in litigation where a large money value is at
stake naturally expects to pay a much larger fee than the
man who employs the same attorney in a minor case.
The man who wants plans for a million dollar building
pays the architect greatly in excess of the one who builds
a one thousand dollar house. The principle is sound and
all parties concerned are satisfied.</p>

<p class='c012'>In the eyes of the Almighty all human lives are of the
same value, and it would be cruelly unjust to attempt to
appraise them on a commercial basis. But this should not
prevent a physician from grading his fees in proportion to
the ability of his patients to pay them. What might seem
like a large amount to a wage earner, would be a mere
trifle to one in more affluent circumstances. The lives of
both are equally dear to them, and both are willing to pay
the doctor according to their respective ability.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>Custom, the mother of much folly, is the only excuse
for adhering to the old, antiquated system. A physician
who is called out of bed on a stormy night to answer an
emergency call from the home of a coal heaver would not
be justified in asking more than the minimum fee. But
why should he perform exactly the same service at exactly
the same charge for one who is able and willing to
pay ten times as much, or even more? It is not sensible,
it is not fair.</p>

<p class='c012'>“But it would be a violation of the code of ethics,” some
one may say. Bah! The code of ethics be —— but that’s
another story which will be told later on in this volume.
The plan suggested, however, is not a violation of the
code of ethics. There is nothing unethical in a physician
regulating his fees to please himself, provided no injustice
is done, and none of his patients is oppressed in this
respect. There are certain physicians in the large cities
who will not respond to a call for less than $25. There
are others who perform the same services for $2. Yet
both kinds are strictly ethical and are recognized by the
medical authorities as such.</p>

<p class='c012'>The reason for this wide difference is that the $25 men
have used business tact in the practice of their profession,
and elevated themselves to a position where, by reason of
their prominence, they are justified in naming whatever
fees they think they can get. And these fees are almost
invariably cash.</p>

<p class='c012'>On the other hand the $2 men are timid in a business
way; they hide their light under a bushel as it were, and
consequently lack widespread reputation. Their fees remain
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>at $2 because they don’t ask any more, and their
ledgers are laden with unpaid accounts.</p>

<p class='c012'>There is no reason why a physician should not collect
his bills with just as much promptness as a merchant. It
is usually his own fault that they go unpaid. Statements
should be sent out regularly on the first of each month,
and if there is no remittance by the 15th, it can be found
inconvenient to make any further calls. This, of course,
is allowing that the patients are able to pay. Where real
inability to meet the bill exists it becomes a matter for the
physician to settle with his own conscience.</p>

<p class='c012'>Our medical schools are full of young men who are
wasting their time and doing the world at large an absolute
injustice by studying medicine. They are doomed to
failure before they are well started because Nature has
not endowed them with necessary qualifications for successful
practitioners. Their instructors realize it, but the
tuition fees are needed for the support of the schools, and
year after year big crops of alleged “doctors” are turned
out. It might be unfair to refer to them as incompetent,
and yet this is what many of them really are. Most of
them know medicine theoretically and know it well, but
lack the vital essentials of success.</p>

<p class='c012'>It would be a simple matter of justice to these young
men if some plan could be devised for weeding out those
who are manifestly unfitted for the practice of medicine
before they have wasted their time and money on medical
instruction. So long as such a plan is lacking it becomes
the duty of the individual to assume this responsibility
himself. The mere desire to become a physician should
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>not satisfy the aspirant for medical lore. He should question
himself closely as to his fitness. His character may
be the best, his ability to acquire the necessary knowledge
unlimited, but unless Nature has equipped him as previously
outlined, the most he can hope to attain in the
medical profession is mediocrity so far as actually helping
the sick, and obtaining prestige and wealth are concerned.</p>

<p class='c012'>There are men, it is true, of high standing in the profession,
who do not possess these qualifications, but they
are few in number and, as a rule, are consulting, rather
than practicing physicians. Other doctors call upon them
for advice because of their recognized skill and learning.
They give this advice wisely and well, but in the sick
room would fall far short of obtaining the same results
which other men, more favored by Nature, obtain by acting
upon the advice they give.</p>

<p class='c012'>Time was when the word “physician,” conveyed the
idea of a man with a beard. The two were intimately connected
in the public mind. In many parts of the country,
especially in remote districts where modern ideas and
knowledge of the germ theory have not penetrated, this
relationship still exists. In such places a full beard is an
efficient badge of the doctor’s calling, and is essential in
establishing his professional identity among the people.</p>

<p class='c012'>Despite the widespread knowledge of the fact that
beards are nothing more nor less than nests and hatching
beds in which millions of disease germs find shelter, there
are to-day numerous localities in which doctors as well as
the laymen cling stubbornly to the belief that a physician
without a beard is “no good.”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>“Go on, neighbor, don’t try to fool me. That man’s no
doctor. How do I know? Why, he ain’t got no beard.”</p>

<p class='c012'>This is no uncommon statement to encounter in rural
regions, and even in some fair-sized towns. Even the doctors
themselves do not appear to recognize the fact that it
is possible to separate their beards from their profession,
and that it would be to the benefit of their patients and the
advancement of their own reputations in the end to do so.</p>

<p class='c012'>Modern, well-educated physicians know that many, in
fact nearly all the ordinary ailments, are of germ origin.
They also know, for instance, that a patient suffering from
typhoid, or typhus, or some like disease, is continually reproducing
these germs in immense numbers. For a physician
with a full beard to lean over the bedside of such a
patient is to invite millions of these germs to invade his
beard, and wherever he goes he carries these germs with
him and spreads the disease.</p>

<p class='c012'>It is bad enough when decent precaution is taken as the
hair of the head, the mustache, and even the clothing itself
will harbor too many of the bacilli. But to wear a beard
is to greatly increase the accommodations for these undesirable
lodgers. In this way the health and lives of thousands
of people are daily jeopardized.</p>

<p class='c012'>This is why beards should have no place on the faces of
physicians, and the more highly educated and more progressive
the physicians are the fewer will be the beards
found among them.</p>

<p class='c012'>Another thing is a prime requisite in successful practice
and this is the most scrupulous cleanliness. This refers
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>not only to the person and apparel of the physician, but
to the instruments which he handles.</p>

<p class='c012'>Some years ago an Iowa cattleman suffering from a
chronic trouble, came to Chicago for treatment which was
administered hypodermatically. He made fair progress
toward recovery, and finally was in condition to return
home where the treatment was continued by his family
physician.</p>

<p class='c012'>For a time the reports made by the Iowa doctor were of
a glowing nature. Mr. —— was getting along nicely,
and the improvement in his condition was nothing short
of miraculous. Suddenly word came that there was a
change for the worse, and the Chicago specialist was requested
to go to Iowa and make an investigation. He did
so. On arriving in the town nearest the patient’s home
he first called upon the local physician and together they
drove out to see Mr. ——. The latter was evidently
fast approaching a collapse and the specialist was at a loss
to account for the remarkable change. He was assured
that his instructions had been closely adhered to, both the
patient and the local doctor agreeing upon this point.
Finally the specialist said:</p>

<p class='c012'>“Doctor, let me see you administer the hypodermatic
part of the treatment.”</p>

<p class='c012'>The local physician took from his overcoat pocket a
hypodermic syringe without case or other protection.
This he stuck into the bottle of fluid which constituted
the treatment, and was about to make the injection when
the specialist shouted:</p>

<p class='c012'>“Great heavens, doctor, don’t do that! Let me see that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>syringe a moment.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Holding the syringe up to the light the specialist found
it extremely dirty on the inside of the glass barrel, and the
needle point covered with lint. Calling the local physician
into an adjoining room he said:</p>

<p class='c012'>“My God, Doctor, it’s a wonder your patient is not
dead. You are poisoning him to death. How long is it
since you sterilized this syringe?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Why, it was sterilized when I got it, wasn’t it?” replied
the local M.D. innocently.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes,” answered the specialist, “and my instructions
were that it should be cleansed with alcohol before and
after every injection, and sterilized in boiling water at
least once a week. This has not been done.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Then and there the visiting physician opened the eyes
of his country brother as to the grave importance of utter
and absolute cleanliness in all branches of practice, and
especially in the administration of hypodermatic treatments.</p>

<p class='c012'>For nearly ten weeks this doctor had not cleansed the
syringe. During all this time he had unconsciously been
injecting into the system of his patient the most virulent
of poison in the form of the decomposed lymph which remained
in the syringe barrel, as well as such foreign substances
as accumulated on the unprotected needle of the
syringe.</p>

<p class='c012'>And yet this “doctor” was popular and successful in a
way, (in mild cases), despite his failure to keep up with
the progress of modern thought. He was one of the old-fashioned
full-bearded type, ignorant of germs and germ-theory,
and too self-opinionated and set in his way to keep
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>himself posted as to what is going on in the world of
medicine.</p>

<p class='c012'>I wish I were able to state honestly that, in the instance
here referred to, the patient recovered, but he did not.
The damage had been done, and it was too late, when the
specialist was called in, to overcome it.</p>

<p class='c012'>This is a truthful narrative. It is being duplicated in
many instances owing to the ignorance and incapacity of
men who, while possessing diplomas, are really unfitted
for the practice of medicine. It illustrates in a sad, but
forceful way, the necessity of being “up to date,” and
mixing common sense with the medical lore acquired in
the schools.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy,” should be the
rule. A physician should never dress flashily, but he
should be garbed well. It creates a good impression. The
time and money expended on improving the personal appearance
is well invested. Patronize a competent tailor.
A portly, well-conditioned man, well clothed, and of
sunny, cheerful ways, will work wonders in the practice
of medicine. Impressions are created largely by appearances.
The man who looks affluent, who conducts himself
in a good-natured, dignified manner, will succeed even
though he be lacking in a thorough knowledge of his profession.
The man who is slouchy and ill-kempt, and who
takes no pains to be pleasant and obliging, will fail, no
matter how well grounded he may be in the science of
medicine. Why? Because he will repel people instead
of attracting them. This same rule holds good in all lines
of business, but it is specially applicable to the practice of
medicine.</p>

  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER III<br /> <br /><b>THE BUGBEAR OF ETHICS</b></h2>
</div>
<p class='c011'>One of the first spooks with which the young practitioner
will be confronted is the bugbear of Ethics—don’t
overlook the big E. It will be in front of him on graduation
day, his preceptor will dangle it before his eyes as he
hands him his papers, and it will be continually bobbing
up after he has hung out his shingle.</p>

<p class='c012'>Now ethics in its place is a good thing. It is especially
essential in the medical profession in which, without a due
regard for the proprieties, many men would be tempted to
go astray. And this temptation is by no means slight at
times. But there is such a thing as overdoing the ethical
proposition. It becomes monotonously annoying for a
man to have his every movement watched and judged
from the ethical standpoint by a lot of self-constituted
censors. The average physician, in his bearing toward
his younger brother does not ask himself the old question,
“Am I my brother’s keeper?” Not at all. On the contrary
the worst of it is he assumes an opposite attitude
and by his actions asserts “I am my brother’s keeper.”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>In a way these men assume the right to dog and spy
upon the movements of other physicians on the plea that
they are doing it for the benefit of the profession—to see
that the great Code of Ethics is not violated. What they
are really after, nine times out of ten, is to make sure that
the young, progressive practitioner who has the tact and
ability to build up a good-paying practice does not encroach
upon their preserves. This is bad enough, but
there is a worse side. In nearly every instance those who
howl the loudest about violations of the code, are gross
offenders themselves. This is a bold assertion, but the
proof will be furnished later on.</p>

<p class='c012'>One of the things specially cited as an unpardonable
violation of ethics is the courting of newspaper and similar
publicity.</p>

<p class='c012'>“My dear boy,” one of these old-time offenders will say,
“you must not allow your name to appear so frequently
in print. It is undignified and unethical. Our profession
is one of mighty dignity and responsibility, and you owe
it to yourself and your brother physicians to avoid anything
which tends to lower or debase it. I know it is only
human to seek notoriety of this kind, and that it is valuable
so far as the mere getting of money goes, but we must
be actuated by higher, nobler motives.”</p>

<p class='c012'>It is practically a certainty—with rare exception—that
the man who gives this advice, is bending every energy,
and using every possible means to secure the same kind
of publicity. He knows that fame and wealth come from
keeping one’s name constantly before the public.</p>

<p class='c012'>In every large city we will find physicians of wealth and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>fame, of whose every movement the newspapers seem to
have information in advance. How do they get it? Let
us analyze the conditions.</p>

<p class='c012'>Under his professional obligation Dr. Soakum is bound
to observe and live up to the code of ethics. He prates
loud and often about the beauties of an ethical life, and
the uninitiated might well suppose that his was a model
existence in this respect. But, is it not a trifle strange
that whenever Dr. Soakum, owing to his great skill and
fame, is called out of town to attend some prominent personage
in another city the newspapermen know he has
been summoned. More than this, they know where he is
going, whom he is going to see, and what train he is going
on. Strange, is it not?</p>

<p class='c012'>It is no uncommon occurrence to read items like the following
in the daily press:</p>
<p class='c016'>Dr. Soakum, the distinguished specialist in chronic disorders, left
for San Francisco yesterday, having been summoned by wire to
attend the Hon. Million Moneybags, who is seriously ill with
chronic nephritis. The patient, whose disability at this time is of
grave import to a number of large business transactions, has been
under the care of a number of famous physicians, but his great
confidence in the skill of Dr. Soakum led to the hasty summoning
of the latter.</p>

<p class='c017'>Dr. Soakum, who was seen by our reporter just as he was boarding
the Overland limited confirmed the report. He added that the
time of his stay was uncertain, as the case is a most important one,
and may demand his undivided attention for some weeks. During his
absence Dr. Soakum’s vast practice will be looked after by his
associate, Dr. Bleedum. He added that he was both surprised and
annoyed to think the news had leaked out.</p>
<p class='c011'>Surprised! Annoyed! Not on your life. This was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>only a bit of stage play, of dramatic action, on the part of
Dr. Soakum. Real surprise, real annoyance and real
anger would have resulted only from the failure of the reporter
to appear after the careful arrangements which had
been made to ensure his attendance.</p>

<p class='c012'>How often have many of us read items like the following
in the daily press:</p>
<p class='c016'>At last there is hope for the consumptive. Dr. Killem, the eminent
specialist, whose success in the treatment of tuberculosis has
aroused wide interest in the medical profession, has made public
the details of his treatment by means of which such wonderful results
have been obtained.</p>

<p class='c017'>“I would have done this long ago,” said Dr. Killem to a reporter
for the <i>Morning Howl</i>, yesterday, “were it not that I desired to be
absolutely certain as to the permanent efficacy of the treatment.
Now that there is no longer room for doubt on this point I feel at
liberty to act.</p>

<p class='c017'>“The essential feature in my method is,”——</p>
<p class='c011'>And Dr. Killem goes on to give what he calls a professional
statement, so involved and beclouded with high-sounding
terms that the poor reporter makes a sorry mess
of this part of his story.</p>

<p class='c012'>Strange as it may seem this is just what Dr. Killem
wants. He knows his treatment will not stand a scientific
analysis by competent men, and he avoids this by intentionally
leading the reporter to misquote. And then it
gives him an opportunity to write a letter of protest to the
newspaper and thus obtain more publicity.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I’m chagrined,” Dr. Killem will say to his professional
brethren. “That reporter for the <i>Morning Howl</i> has made
an ass of me, but I suppose there is no redress. I gave
him a few, a very few facts, out of kindness, and he has
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>distorted them and made me ridiculous.”</p>

<p class='c012'>And all the time Dr. Killem is swelling with pride. He
has “put another one over” on the press, and obtained a
lot of valuable publicity that he could not have bought
outright. Besides he would not think of doing such a
thing as to pay for advertising—it would be unethical.</p>

<p class='c012'>How do you suppose the newspapers get hold of such
items? Reporters are a pretty smart lot of men with
noses keenly trained on the scent of news. But none of
them, so far as known, possesses the gift of being able to
tell in advance what is going to occur at a given time.
Smart as they are it would be out of the question for them
to know that Dr. Soakum had been called out of town,
or that Dr. Killem had interesting information to impart
to the public, unless they got tips to this effect, and these
tips are just exactly what they get.</p>

<p class='c012'>None of these physicians have press agents. Perish the
thought. That would be decidedly unethical, and too
clumsily convictive. No siree. They are too smart for
that. Most of them, however, especially those who work
the press continually, have private secretaries. The private
secretary work is light, and is attended to by
stenographers and book-keepers, but the title affords a
handy cloak for disguising the press agent. Ostensibly
engaged as private secretaries the men who fill these
positions know full well that their one and only duty is
to “boost” the professional prowess of their employers;
to keep them constantly before the public.</p>

<p class='c012'>Frequently this work is done by men who have no
open, direct connection with the physicians who employ
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>them; are not even seen around their offices. This is the
latest dodge, and is becoming more and more general. It
has one decided advantage in the fact that it is impossible
to trace any collusion between the party who gives out
the news, and the party who is benefited by the publication.
It also has a further advantage. It enables the
physician to put on an air of surprise, should he be questioned
by a brother doctor, and say:</p>

<p class='c012'>“Smith. Who is he? He is not on my office staff, and
is certainly assuming a lot when he pretends to speak for
me.”</p>

<p class='c012'>All of these press agents work on the same lines. They
know the avidity with which city editors grab for news,
particularly if it concerns prominent people. When the
occasion arises they get into communication with some
city editor, generally by phone, and a conversation something
like the following ensues:</p>

<p class='c012'>“Hello, that you Brown? This is Jones. Yes, the
same, old man. Thanks. I’ve just got onto something
that looks like a good tip, and I thought you would like
to have it. Dr. Soakum has been called to San Francisco
to attend old Moneybags, the trust magnate. If the old
chap should die it would raise Old Ned in the stock
market. I understand that Soakum goes this afternoon
on the U. P. limited. Oh, don’t mention it. I’m glad to
be able to give you the tip. Hope you’ll be able to get a
story out of it.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Jones, the press agent, does not, of course, tell his city
editor friend that there’s $25 in for him (Jones) if the
story is printed. He’s too smart for that. So far as the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>city editor knows Jones is simply trying to do him a favor
in a news way. The press agent is also smart in another
direction—he does not call on the same city editor too
often. It might arouse suspicion.</p>

<p class='c012'>In nearly every city of any size there are a number of
newspapers. Jones works them in rotation, so far as Dr.
Soakum is concerned. First it is the <i>Morning Howl</i>, then
the <i>Daily Screech</i>, next the <i>Evening Whirl</i>, and so on. Between
the Dr. Soakum stories Jones works in items about
other people, for the modern press agent is an enterprising
chap who represents a number of clients all eager for
publicity. A good press agent can look after the interests
of a physician, a lawyer, an actor, and a promoter at all
the same time, and not overwork himself. It’s merely a
matter of giving out the right tips in the right way. If
the tip looks good the city editor and his staff does the
rest.</p>

<p class='c012'>To preserve his standing with the newspaper fraternity
Jones very frequently, if he is a real live, first-class press
agent, tips off a bit of actual news, something in which
there is no $25 for him, and which makes the city editors
rise up and call him blessed. Incidentally it also makes
them all the more willing to act upon his next tip, and
this is just what Jones wants. He is merely sowing seed
for the crop he is to reap in the near future.</p>

<p class='c012'>And do reputable physicians countenance this sort of
thing? you may ask. They certainly do; not all of them,
it is true, but a big working majority. The large cities
are full of physicians of wealth and fame who have been
literally boosted into prominence by the newspapers.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>Fancy the effect upon the public when it reads of Dr.
Soakum being called to attend so distinguished a citizen
as the Hon. Million Moneybags, or references to
Dr. Killem, “the eminent authority on tuberculosis.” It
means a stream of dollars rolling into the pockets of the
doctors thus referred to, and puts them in position to
name larger fees.</p>

<p class='c012'>There are times when as a matter of business precaution
the press agent resorts to opposite tactics. It would
not look well to be lauding Dr. Soakum all the time. So,
having previously laid out the program with the former,
the press agent hunts up another physician who knows
how others are prospering through publicity and is not
averse to having some of it for himself. The program is
explained to Dr. Squills, and he writes to the newspapers,
bringing to their attention some supposedly important
medical subject. It may relate to hygiene, bad management
of hospitals, unsanitary condition of street cars, the
proper means of stopping the spread of tuberculosis, anything
to attract public attention.</p>

<p class='c012'>City editors, unless overcrowded with more important
matter—and the press agent generally selects the opportune
moment—will print this kind of “stuff” in full.
Having printed it about the first thing they will do is to
send out reporters to ask the “eminent Dr. Soakum” for
his opinion on the subject. This is just what Dr. Squills
was induced to break into print for. Dr. Soakum will
endorse the latter’s letter, praise it warmly and perhaps
bring out some new points which Squills has purposely
overlooked. This gives Squills a chance to come back
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>with a statement as to the importance of the suggestions
made by Dr. Soakum, and the two old hypocrites thus
get a lot more free advertising. All of which means more
prominence, more fame, and more money.</p>

<p class='c012'>Some years ago—about ten at this writing—a new
treatment for chronic nervous and mental ailments was
introduced. Its sponsors were men of high standing in
the profession, instructors in leading medical colleges.
That the treatment had great merit is undeniable; many
wonderful results were accomplished with it. It also had
great money-making possibilities, but the promoters did
not know how to develop this feature.</p>

<p class='c012'>Finally they engaged a press agent—we’ll call him
Mr. Johnson, because that is not his name. His terms
were $50 a week salary, and a royalty on the business.
For three or four days Mr. Johnson did nothing except
post himself as to the scientific features of the treatment
and he was soon able to talk more glibly and intelligently
about it than the physicians in charge. Then one day he
said:</p>

<p class='c012'>“Trot out some of your star cases. I want to look them
over.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Mr. Johnson went over the records carefully and
selected one which seemed to give promise of producing
a big free advertisement. It was that of a well-known,
well-to-do merchant in a neighboring city who a year
before had been seized with primary dementia. Homicidal
tendencies developed and his family, on the advice
of prominent alienists, placed him in a sanitarium, the
physicians at which, as well as those called in by the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>family, pronounced the case absolutely incurable and
hopeless.</p>

<p class='c012'>In time the new treatment was administered. In
ninety days the patient was discharged as cured, returned
to his home, and resumed charge of his business. To this
day he is well mentally and physically, and no one, unacquainted
with his history, would ever think he had
been insane, and confined as a dangerous lunatic.</p>

<p class='c012'>Having satisfied himself as to the accuracy of the story,
Johnson’s next move was to plan out a line of action.
The story to be acceptable in a news way, and carry
plausibility with it must come from the patient’s home
town. It would never do for Johnson to offer it to the
newspapers himself. His connection with it must be
carefully concealed. The first thing he did in this direction
was to ascertain who handled the correspondence
that was sent out to the big dailies from this particular
town. He found that it was virtually in the hands of a
Mr. Wheeling, city editor of a local paper.</p>

<p class='c012'>Armed with this knowledge Johnson took a train and
went to the town in question—it is only a few miles from
Chicago—timing himself so as to arrive there when Mr.
Wheeling had finished his rush work for the day. Arriving
there he introduced himself to Wheeling as follows:</p>

<p class='c012'>“My name is Johnson. Pardon me for intruding upon
you, but I’m a stranger in town, with a little spare time
on my hands, and being somewhat of a newspaper man
myself it seems sort of homelike to poke around an
editor’s den. It’s the best way I have of killing time and,
if it doesn’t annoy you, I’d like to pass away an hour or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>so chatting over newspaper work and newspaper men.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Wheeling, a cordial, whole-souled chap, made Johnson
welcome, and they were soon very friendly, exchanging
reminiscences, and regaling one another with their experiences.
Johnson was in no hurry to spring the trap. He
was too smart for that. He produced some good cigars
and, after they had talked for an hour or so, invited
Wheeling to take dinner with him at the hotel. Wheeling
accepted, and after the meal, when fresh cigars were
lighted, Johnson proceeded to set his trap as follows:</p>

<p class='c012'>“Once a man has the newspaper fever he never gets it
out of his blood, at least not entirely. I’m better off now
financially than I could possibly expect to be working as
a reporter or editor, and yet frequently the old desire to
cover an assignment, or write a good story, takes hold of
me, and takes hold hard. It’s galling for a man of my
disposition to run against a good story and not be able
to make use of it, but this is happening with me right
along. Why this very afternoon, in conversation with a
business friend just before I met you, I heard a story
that’s a corker, and would make a big sensation if it ever
got into print. But pshaw, what’s the use of talking, I’m
simply not in position to make use of it, and might as
well pass it up. It goes against the grain though, I can
assure you.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Why not give me the tip?” asked Wheeling. “I’m
correspondent here for quite a list of papers, and a real
live story, one that I could spread on, would mean considerable
to me.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Well,” replied Johnson, “I don’t mind giving you such
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>facts as I have, but of course I can’t vouch for their
accuracy. All I can say is that if your investigation
establishes the truth of what I have heard all the big
papers will want the story by the column, and then
some.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Johnson then proceeded to outline the story to Wheeling,
hesitating purposely as if not quite sure of the
patient’s name, and giving one that sounded much like it,
but was not the real one. The trap was sprung. Wheeling
knew the man, and at once realized that he was in
line for a big Sunday spread. It would not do to waste
so good a yarn on the daily issues in which a stick or two
of space would be the limit when he could place a column
or more in each of the Sunday papers. Wheeling furnished
his correspondence at space rates, so much per
column, and he naturally wanted to make the story as full
and complete as possible.</p>

<p class='c012'>That very night (it was Monday) he visited the home
of the miraculously cured man. The latter talked freely,
corroborating all the important details. Wheeling’s next
visit was to the home of the family physician, and there
he got more corroboration. The next morning he wired
the various Sunday editors as follows:</p>
<p class='c016'>Prominent business man here, after being pronounced incurably
insane by eminent specialists, and confined in asylum, fully restored
to reason by new and novel treatment. Big story. How
much?</p>
<p class='c011'>He was swamped with replies. Every Sunday editor
wanted more or less of it. Most of them wanted it in
full, the orders reading something like this:</p>
<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>If sure of facts, and man is really prominent, send story in full.
No limit. Also get pictures of patient, and others concerned.</p>
<p class='c011'>The following Sunday morning every newspaper in
Chicago fairly “shrieked” forth the news of the new treatment.
It was given to the public in the form of a first-page
story with the emphasis of leaded type, “scare”
heads, and pictures of the patient. The Associated Press
took it up and wired a report to all American papers,
while a condensed statement was cabled abroad.</p>

<p class='c012'>Nor was this all. Managing editors from New York
to San Francisco, from Toronto to New Orleans, called
upon their special correspondents to rush more particulars
by wire. The managing editors of the Chicago
papers instructed their city editors to obtain statements
in full from the physicians interested, as to the scientific
nature of the treatment, its history, etc. (The names and
addresses of these physicians being given in the first
story, the locating of them was easy—it was part of Mr.
Johnson’s plan.)</p>

<p class='c012'>What was the result? The new treatment was immediately
“boosted” into world-wide prominence. Half a
million dollars would not have paid for the publicity it
obtained in one week. Indeed it would have been impossible
to buy this kind of publicity—straight news—at any
price. It made fortunes for the men interested. To-day,
ten years after this publicity, these men are still reaping
its benefits.</p>

<p class='c012'>Now these men, it should be remembered, were and
are strictly ethical. They frown upon anything that
smacks of violation of the code. They will not sell the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>treatment to physicians who advertise. Their dealings
are confined to those who can show a clean bill of health
in this connection. To those who meet the demands in
this respect they furnish the treatment at $27.50 per
2-ounce vial; the cost of producing it is about 75 cents.
Nice profitable business? Well, rather.</p>

<p class='c012'>The lesson of all this is that it pays physicians to advertise,
provided they do it in the right way, and are
clever enough to hoodwink their professional brethren as
well as the general public on the question of ethics. The
man who openly engages a real press agent and pays his
money for “display ads” in the newspapers is tabooed,
his name is anathema. The man who engages a press
agent quietly to get up schemes by which the gentlemen
of the press may be worked for valuable publicity is thoroughly
ethical, and remains in good standing in the
profession.</p>

<p class='c012'>Wherein lies the distinction? I must confess that it is
too fine for me. Of the two the honor seems to be with
the doctor who proceeds to ask for patients in a straight-forward
business-like manner, and pays the newspapers
for the space they give him. On the one hand we have
the man who pays for what he gets, while on the other
we have him who, in reality, is obtaining goods under
false pretences.</p>

<p class='c012'>Just another point about ethics. It is strictly unethical
for a physician to prescribe or administer a remedy the
formula of which he does not thoroughly understand.
But thousands of them are doing it daily. Where is the
physician, for instance, who knows in reality, aside from
the proprietors, the composition of Anti-Kamnia, but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>does lack of this knowledge stop its widespread use?
Not at all. It’s the same way with acetanalid and scores
of other preparations. Occasionally the proprietors of
some remedies seek to ease the conscience of some extra
scrupulous practitioner by printing what appears to be a
formula. But in such cases there can be no assurance
that the formula is correctly stated, the proper quantities
given, or the method of preparation absolutely stated. In
all such cases the alleged facts must be taken on faith.</p>

<p class='c012'>The author has in mind one particular instance, the
accuracy of which he can vouch for because he was interested
in the preparation and sale of the remedy. A certain
hypodermatic treatment was placed on the medical
market “for the use of physicians only.” To satisfy the
ethical gentlemen the formula was given, and it was
given correctly. Nothing, however, was said about the
method of preservation. This was an important item as
the remedy consisted of a combination of animal tissues
and fluids which would decompose quickly, and if injected
into the human system would work havoc. To
keep it in condition for use, with its curative properties
intact, it was necessary to put it through a preservative
process in the course of which various chemicals and
other substances were added. Nothing was said in the
formula about this feature, nor did the strictly ethical
physicians who used it make any enquiry about it.</p>

<p class='c012'>Common sense, to say nothing about medical training,
should have told them that a remedy prepared after the
formula as stated must decompose rapidly unless some
preservative process was employed, but a little thing like
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>this did not seem to bother them. They just simply
glanced at the formula, wondered they had not thought of
it themselves, and jabbed it into their patients according
to directions.</p>

<p class='c012'>What assurance did they have that, if the remedy was
not properly preserved it would not injure, and perhaps
kill the people upon whom it was used? What assurance
did they have that, if the remedy had been put through
a preservative process, it did not contain some substance
which would be equally injurious? None whatever.
Their actions were equivalent to saying they didn’t care.</p>

<p class='c012'>This, to the careful, conscientious physician, would
seem like coming close to the danger mark, and so it was.
To speak plainly it was little short of criminal carelessness,
and yet these practitioners were all thoroughly
ethical. The only possible excuse for them is to say they
thought they knew, but this is actually no excuse at all
as, under their obligation it was their duty to know beyond
doubt what they were using.</p>

<p class='c012'>As Dr. Lydston asks in the opening chapter, “Why not
be honest” about this publicity matter, and, he might well
have added, all the other features of modern medical
practice as well. There is no excuse for honest practitioners
leaving the use of the public press to quacks and
fakirs—and the few really good physicians who are smart
enough to take advantage of it while at the same time
“pulling the wool over the eyes” of their professional
brethren.</p>

<p class='c012'>Such tactics as now prevail, cloaked under the guise of
ethics, are unfair to the young medic. They keep him
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>from doing the very thing which the self-appointed Lord
High Apostles of Ethics are doing, and waxing rich and
famous thereby.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>
  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER IV<br /> <br /><b>LAWFUL TO ADVERTISE</b></h2>
</div>
<p class='c011'>Just who put forth the dictum that it is unlawful, unprofessional,
unethical, for a physician to advertise is
unknown. It was probably some old codger of antiquarian
ideas. At any rate the rule—and it is a rule—is
so old it reeks with decay. But, among progressive
physicians, it is fast coming to be recognized as a rule
which is “more honored in the breach than in the observance.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Other professional men who were once held in bonds
of the same nature are breaking away. We find in the
public press the cards of attorneys, architects and civil
engineers, all callings which are legitimately dignified
with the name of “professions.” No exception is taken to
these men making their talents known, although at one
time—and it is only a few years ago—they were held in
ethical bonds just as strong and binding as those with
which the medical practitioner is now enchained.</p>

<p class='c012'>But time changes all things. It has changed to a degree
the code of ethics which formerly obtained in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>professions of law, architecture, and civil engineering,
and it is slowly, but surely, changing that of medicine.
True the wording of the various codes remain the same,
but there is a growing tendency to wink at, to overlook
evasions.</p>

<p class='c012'>It has become a matter of convenience to the public to
know where to find a competent lawyer, or architect, or
civil engineer. Hence the appearance of their business
cards in newspapers. On the same grounds publicity by
physicians is justifiable. It is more than justifiable.
Mankind can, in a pinch, get along without attorneys or
architects or engineers. That is to say it is rarely imperative
their services should be requisitioned in a hurry.
The trial of a law case, the plans for a building, or the
construction of a bridge can generally be put off for a few
days at least without serious injury or inconvenience to
any body.</p>

<p class='c012'>When a doctor is needed he is generally needed badly.
It may not always be an emergency case, but almost invariably
when the services of a physician are required,
even in chronic ailments, delay only aggravates the
patient’s condition.</p>

<p class='c012'>If a medical man has, by special study, equipped himself
to handle a certain class of diseases more intelligently
and satisfactorily than the general practitioner it becomes
his duty to let the public know about it. If we accept the
dictum of the censors of medical propriety as they present
it—that the obligation taken by the physician binds
him to serve the public to the best of his ability—then
surely we can not get away from the proposition that men
of unusual ability are in duty bound to make the public
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>acquainted with that ability. The successful physician
does not live up to his obligation if he “hides his light
under a bushel.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Medical societies, the watchdogs of ethics, do not
accept this doctrine. Not only this; they try to drive out
of practice, to brand with infamy, to make an outcast and
wanderer of the man who indulges in it. The “it” in this
instance refers to publicity fairly bought and honestly
paid for over the newspaper counter. But they do not
always succeed.</p>

<p class='c012'>For years Dr. McCoy had been a surgeon at Bellevue
hospital, New York, a man of rare skill and of high standing
in his profession. He was a member of various medical
societies, respected and honored. After a long,
weary experience he made up his mind that he was entitled
to a better financial reward than it was possible for
him to obtain in hospital or private practice. He came to
Chicago, obtained a certificate from the State authorities,
and began advertising in the daily newspapers as a
specialist. His medical brethren were horrified. Remonstrance
being of no avail, they promptly ousted
Dr. McCoy from membership in the professional
societies.</p>

<p class='c012'>Not content with this they went further and filed complaint
with the state authorities with the purpose of having
his certificate, or license to practice, revoked. That
they would have succeeded in this if Dr. McCoy had not
taken the matter into the courts, is a certainty, as the
members of the State Board of Health who would pass
upon the question were all physicians and prominent in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>the societies which were seeking to deprive McCoy of
his certificate.</p>

<p class='c012'>A long, hard-fought battle in the courts was won by
McCoy. In handing down its verdict the final court said
in effect:</p>

<p class='c012'>“We fail to see wherein this appellant has committed
any offense against the laws of the State. If he was competent
to practice medicine at the time he received his
license he is competent to practice now. Nothing that
has been alleged against him has affected in any way his
ability, fitness, or competency as a medical practitioner.
Neither has he committed any penal offense. True he
has advertised, but advertising is not a felony; not even
a misdemeanor.</p>

<p class='c012'>“The fact that the medical societies to which he belonged
have revoked his membership has no bearing on
the case. These societies have no official powers so far
as the State is concerned. They may very properly say
who may, or who may not, hold membership with them,
but they have no authority to say who may, or who may
not practice medicine. Societies of this kind are purely
social and professional; they are not endowed with executive,
administrative, or legislative power to act for the
State.”</p>

<p class='c012'>This finding established in a forceful, indisputable
manner the legal right of a physician to advertise his skill
as a healer of mankind without affecting his ability. It
was not to the liking of the sticklers for ethics who control
the medical organizations. They would have the
young medics believe—and up to the time the McCoy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>case was decided they had succeeded—that they were all
powerful; that their word was law, not only as regards
membership in the societies, but also as to who might, or
might not, practice medicine. They succeeded because
they controlled the State Board of Health. But the ruling
of the court put an end to this impudent assumption
of authority. It laid down and made clear the important
fact that, in passing upon the competency of applicants
for licenses, medical ability and good moral character
were the sole and only points to be considered.</p>

<p class='c012'>There is advertising and advertising, one kind respectable
and dignified; the other outrageously bad. The
author would not for a moment countenance the use of
flamboyant “ads” like those with which the “weak men”
and other quacks bombard the public through the daily
press. Such advertising as a general thing is positively
indecent and dishonest. The men who place it and the
newspaper publishers who print it should be prosecuted
into the penitentiary. It is a queer thing that so-called
high-class newspapers which decline to accept lottery and
get-rich-quick “ads” on the ground of morality (we’ll say
nothing of their illegality) will openly solicit and publish
the disgusting business advertisements of medical charlatans
and fakirs.</p>

<p class='c012'>No man who respects himself or his profession will
“guarantee a cure or money refunded,” no matter how
apparently simple or mild the ailment he undertakes to
treat may be. Neither will he offer to take cases on the
“no money until you are cured” plan. These are methods
which belong exclusively in the realm of quackdom.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>They deceive only the ignorant, and are used with success
only among that class of people. But baits of this
kind stare one in the face from nearly every Sunday
newspaper, and from many fences.</p>

<p class='c012'>Then there is the fakir who calls upon you in loud type
to “See Old Doctor Squeeze-em. He’ll do you good!”
It’s a safe bet he will “do” you good if he ever gets you
into his clutches; “do” you so good that you will be lucky
to have carfare left to get home with.</p>

<p class='c012'>These are not the methods employed by smart men
who, through publicity, obtain a good practice, and put
themselves in position to command large fees; men to
whom patients will pay $100 for an hour’s consultation
and advice without hesitation, while they would begrudge
$5 to a physician of equally as much or more medical
skill, but not so well versed in the art of self publicity.</p>

<p class='c012'>How do these men get before the public? They pave
the way according to well-laid plans. Their every move
is part of a previously laid-out program. We are writing
now of those who have not progressed to the stage of
employing regular press agents, or have not become well-known
enough to warrant regular advertising. They
join some fashionable church and mix in its affairs; take
prominent part in the sociables and other doings, and
when the ladies come around with a grab bag, or “take a
chance on a nice piano,” dig down deep into their jeans.
They may have to get along on short rations for a day or
two, but the money has been invested to better advantage
than if it were expended for pork and beans. A short
course of this kind gets all the women talking about what
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>a charming man Dr. Swell is, and so liberal. Pretty soon
they begin to boost him into prominence by insisting
upon his taking charge of some of their social affairs, and
then his name gets into the papers. This is the beginning.
The oftener he is mentioned the more impressed
the newspaper men become with the belief that he must
be a man of importance, and the first thing Dr. Swell
knows he is getting the most valuable kind of publicity
by the column.</p>

<p class='c012'>And the male part of the community? Well, it’s just
as easy to “con” them as it is the women. Dr. Swell joins
lodge after lodge, society after society, just as fast as he
can raise money for the dues. He attends the sessions
faithfully, and, so far as outward appearances go, takes a
deep interest in the proceedings. He has a good word,
and a warm, hearty hand shake for all the brothers.
While modest, he always manages to have a word to say
“right out in meeting” at the proper time, even if it is no
more than to voice approval of something that has been
done. Then, in time, it comes quite natural for the presiding
Squeejicks, or whatever his title may be, to frequently
say, “We would like to hear from Dr. Swell on
this matter.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Dr. Swell is coming on. If he keeps his head down to
a normal size, treats everybody courteously, and goes
along making friends at every opportunity, the first thing
he knows is that he is nominated for the office of Worthy
High Jinks. Of course he protests that there are others
better fitted, etc., but he doesn’t mean it. He is elected,
and again there is legitimate excuse for getting more
publicity. All the papers announce that:</p>
<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>“At its annual meeting last night Cockalorum Lodge No. 37840,
O.B.O.A.B., elected Dr. What A. Swell as Worthy High Jinks.
Under his regime Cockalorum Lodge will make many advancements
during the coming year. When Dr. Swell was asked to outline his
program last night he said:”</p>
<p class='c011'>And here follows a lengthy interview which Dr. Swell,
knowing he was sure to be elected, had prepared in advance.
From then on it is easy sailing—if he is a smart
man. He manages to keep Cockalorum Lodge doing
something all the time; not that he is so desperately in
love with the lodge, but because it means more and more
publicity to Dr. Swell. As with Cockalorum, so with the
other lodges, or churches, or societies to which he may
belong.</p>

<p class='c012'>From being at first a mere atom of news, Dr. Swell
finally becomes an actual necessity to the newspaper fraternity.
Its members have acquired the habit of turning
to him involuntarily whenever a news problem presents
itself. If the cable brings information that Emperor
William has a sore throat reporters besiege Dr. Swell.
He talks learnedly (or he should) of the nature of the
trouble, and outlines the proper course of treatment, etc.
Again it is heralded to the community that:</p>

<p class='c012'>“On being asked concerning the nature of Emperor
William’s ailment, Dr. Swell, the eminent authority on
diseases of the throat, said——”</p>

<p class='c012'>Is Dr. Swell coming on? Not at all. He has arrived—landed
on both feet as it were. He is There and It.
From then on it is only a matter of taking advantage of
his opportunities. He may remove to a larger city where
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>the services of a shrewd press agent will be necessary to
secure the desired publicity, or he may stay in the smaller
place where he has gotten a good start, and keep up the
good work by a judicious distribution of coin among the
newspaper boys. Not as a bribe, dear me no. That
would be too raw. It would give the doctor dead away,
and kill the game.</p>

<p class='c012'>There are physicians in every large city who seem
to be vital to the existence of the prominent newspapers.
“See Dr. Blank,” is the order that goes forth
from the city editors on every possible occasion, important
or unimportant. Let the government chemist
declare that ice cream is impure and deleterious to
health, and a hundred Dr. Blanks in as many different
cities will be interviewed at length and their views, often
worthless, spread before the public adorned with glaring
headlines.</p>

<p class='c012'>Let the Ahkoond of Swat sneeze and at once we are
regaled with the views of the favored doctors as to the
evils of hay fever and the best means of counteracting
them.</p>

<p class='c012'>It is a poor schemer of a physician who can not in some
manner, through lodge, society, or other connections,
make the acquaintance of at least one city editor and,
without obtrusion, make himself so valuable to the scribe
that he becomes, as it were, an unsalaried member of the
staff, ready at all times to help his dear friend the city
editor out whenever the latter wants anything in the line
of medical information.</p>

<p class='c012'>Blame these doctors? Not at all. On the other hand
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>I feel like patting them on the back and saying: “Go it,
boys. I admire your fine work. You’ve got Bunko Bill
beaten to a frazzle.”</p>

<p class='c012'>There is one doctor now famous because he is quoted
almost daily in the newspapers, who ten years ago was
in hard luck financially. One day he was introduced, or
rather introduced himself, to a city editor by calling at
the latter’s office on an apparently innocuous errand. It
happened just at the time (accidentally, of course) when
public interest was aroused over the prevalence of infantile
paralysis. After the doctor had concluded the
business on which he called, the editor, finding him an
intelligent, well-informed man, asked his opinion on the
medical sensation of the day. This was the doctor’s opportunity,
and he took full advantage of it.</p>

<p class='c012'>“That is an important matter,” he replied, “and no
professional man should discuss it hurriedly or carelessly.
I have some pressing calls to make (this was a whopper)
and haven’t the time to spare just now, but I’ll be
delighted to give you my views within a few hours.”</p>

<p class='c012'>This was acceptable, so the doctor went to a friend’s
library, read up on the subject as thoroughly as he could
in such a short time, and a few hours later was back in
the editorial sanctum. Here he talked so well that the
editor said:</p>

<p class='c012'>“By Jove, doctor. That’s the kind of stuff I want.
Can’t you write it out for me? I’m afraid to trust a reporter,
as there would be a risk of getting it muddled.
I’ll give you a good stenographer to dictate to.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Barkis, which in this case was the doctor, was willing.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>He dictated the matter, and the next morning was
paraded on the first page in big type as “the eminent
Dr. ——”</p>

<p class='c012'>His fortune dated from that day. Patients came in by
the score. His newspaper friend had occasion to call on
him frequently for information on current medical topics,
and he was in print so much that his name was on everybody’s
tongue. That was fame, and a kind of fame that
brought wealth.</p>

<p class='c012'>This particular medic had the gift of a real bunko artist.
He knew how to keep the good thing moving, and to
“con” the city editor who thought he was above being
caught.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Really, my dear Mr. ——,” the doctor would say when
asked by phone for a statement, “really I’m too busy to
do the subject justice, but I can’t refuse you. Send a
stenographer over and I’ll dictate something. By the
way, the <i>World</i> and the <i>Express</i> both wanted something
but I had to turn them down.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Did the city editor appreciate this favoritism? He
certainly did, and saw to it that the doctor got all there
was coming in the way of double leads, scare heads, and
top of column positions.</p>

  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER V<br /> <br /><b>GETTING COUNTRY PATIENTS</b></h2>
</div>
<p class='c011'>While the kind of publicity outlined in the preceding
chapter is valuable and will make a man famous in his
own city, it takes a long time to reach the people in outside
territory. It is a peculiar fact that in medicine, as
well as in other things, “distance lends enchantment.”
The person afflicted with a chronic ailment who lives in
the same town with a physician who has become famous
for his successes in that line, is more apt to postpone his
call for relief than one who lives at a distance.</p>

<p class='c012'>The local patient argues to himself: “There’s no immediate
hurry. I’ve been afflicted in this way ten years
and I’m too busy just now to take the time to see the
doctor. He’s right here in town, and I can reach him at
any time. I’ll drop in on him some day when I’ve got
more leisure.”</p>

<p class='c012'>A certain proportion of the physician’s town folk respond
to the publicity bait, but he must have the fat fish
from outside if he is really going to get large fees in great
number. How is he going to reach them? Here is the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>plan successfully worked by one doctor who has made
himself wealthy.</p>

<p class='c012'>He made arrangements with an advertising agency to
secure the insertion of “pure reading matter” ads in a
number of country newspapers in towns within 500 miles
of Chicago. His press agent then prepared an article
reading about as follows:</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c005'>
    <div><b>LOCOMOTOR ATAXIA CURED!</b></div>
  </div>

<hr class='c003' />
<p class='c019'><b>Prominent Man Afflicted With This Terrible Ailment For
Many Years, Restored to Sound Health After a Short
Treatment.</b></p>
<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>New York</span>, June 10.—Among the passengers on the outgoing
steamer Cedric which sailed to-day for Liverpool, was Col. H. B.
Thomas, of London, who is returning to his home after being successfully
treated for locomotor ataxia. He walks freely, and is
apparently in the best of health. When asked if it was a fact that
he had been cured of locomotor ataxia, an ailment which most
physicians pronounce incurable, Col. Thomas said:</p>

<p class='c017'>“It certainly looks like it. This is the first time I have been able
to walk freely, or have been without pain in ten years. I was on
crutches and suffering the torments of the damned when I came
to this country to take the treatment four months ago. You can see
for yourself the condition I am in now.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Where did you take treatment?”</p>

<p class='c017'>“With Dr. G. H. Wilkinson in Chicago. When I first got there
he had to visit me at my hotel, but after the first two weeks of
treatment I was able to walk to his office at —— Michigan Ave.
Improvement was reasonably rapid, remarkably so, considering the
obstinate nature of the ailment. Now I can walk as well as anybody,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>the pains have left me, and all my bodily functions are
normal.”</p>
<p class='c011'>Newspapers in the smaller towns and cities are not so
particular in the definition of the term “pure news reading
matter” as their larger and more prosperous contemporaries.
They need the money. Consequently all
the publishers who received an order from the ——
Advertising Agency printed the article.</p>

<p class='c012'>Country people as a rule are closer readers than those
in the larger cities, and within a week everybody in the
territory thus reached who was afflicted with locomotor
ataxia was talking about the wonderful case of Col.
Thomas, and writing to Dr. Wilkinson (this is not his
real name) about their own cases.</p>

<p class='c012'>Here again the services of the doctor’s secretary, who
was correspondent as well as press agent, were called
into play. Every letter was answered in a kindly, sympathetic
manner, somewhat as follows, the stationery
used being very plain and neat, but of the best obtainable
material, and modestly engraved:</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c020'>
    <div>G. H. WILKINSON, M.D.</div>
    <div class='c000'>SPECIALIST IN CHRONIC DISEASES</div>
    <div class='c000'>—— Michigan Avenue</div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class='c021'><span class='sc'>Chicago</span>, August 2, 1910.</div>

<p class='c017'><i>Mr. John Smith, Godfrey’s Corners, Ia.</i></p>

<p class='c017'><span class='sc'>Dear Sir</span>: Replying to your letter of July 31st, I regret being
compelled to say that, in the absence of opportunity for a complete
personal examination, it would be impossible for me to say definitely
what may or may not be done for you in the way of obtaining
relief. If you can arrange to come to Chicago for a few days I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>will give your case my earnest personal attention and will then
be in position to advise with you more satisfactorily.</p>

<p class='c017'>Judging from the description of your symptoms the case is plainly
one of locomotor ataxia but the ailment, as you are doubtless
aware, is of such an insidious nature that, aside from the more
prominent general and unmistakable indications, there are few
cases which manifest themselves exactly alike. It is as a rule more
satisfactory to both patient and physician, and more productive of
good results, when the treatment can be arranged under the physician’s
personal supervision to meet the requirements of the individual.
This may possibly require a week, at the end of which
time you may return to your home and continue the treatment there
under the direction of your family physician.</p>

<p class='c017'>As regards guaranteeing a cure I must say frankly that this is
something no reputable physician will do. It is a practice resorted
to only by what are known in the profession as quacks. The
most encouragement I can give you, in the absence of a personal
examination, is that, judging from your description the case is no
worse than scores of others in which entirely satisfactory results
have been obtained.</p>

<p class='c017'>Should you decide to visit me please advise me by letter or wire
a short time in advance so arrangements may be made to give you
prompt attention on arrival.</p>

<div class='c021'>Yours respectfully,</div>
<div class='c021'>————</div>
<p class='c011'>The effect of such a letter on the recipient is to beget
confidence in the writer. It is frank and straightforward;
it sounds honest, especially in those parts which refer to
the necessity of a personal examination, and the declination
to guarantee a cure. “That’s a real man, not a bit
stuck up,” is the comment frequently made on receipt of
one of these letters by people who had hesitated to write
to such a famous specialist.</p>

<p class='c012'>Few country people will take up treatment with a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>strange physician without first consulting their family
doctor. They are not always governed by what he says,
but they almost invariably ask his advice. If he suggests
a trial you are pretty sure to get the patient. If he advises
negatively the patient is not always lost, but it will
require more correspondence, and when the subject does
arrive he will be suspicious and hard to handle.</p>

<p class='c012'>When the family doctor reads a letter like the one
quoted he feels flattered that an eminent specialist should
be willing to entrust the administration of his treatment
to his care. He looks upon the proposition differently
from what he would if this sentence had been omitted.
His vanity has been touched. Inclined at first to throw
cold water on the proposition, when he comes to this part
he generally says:</p>

<p class='c012'>“Well, of course I don’t know anything about this
treatment, but Dr. Wilkinson is a man of great reputation.
His success in the Thomas case is remarkable.
One thing is certain. We have exhausted every resource
here without getting results, and it can’t do any harm to
see him and get his opinion.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Thus encouraged the sufferer, if able to travel, will in
nine cases out of ten, arrange to visit the specialist at the
latter’s office. Sometimes the family doctor, from honest
desire to become acquainted with the details of a new and
successful treatment, will volunteer to accompany him.</p>

<p class='c012'>But, suppose the local physician vetoes the proposition,
denounces it as a fraud, and declines to be associated
with it. Is the patient’s business lost? Not at all.
It merely calls for a little more diplomacy. After waiting
a reasonable time, say a couple of weeks, without
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>hearing from Mr. Smith, the latter gets another letter
from Dr. Wilkinson. This time the specialist writes as
follows:</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c020'>
    <div>G. H. WILKINSON, M.D.</div>
    <div class='c000'>SPECIALIST IN CHRONIC DISEASES</div>
    <div class='c000'>—— Michigan Avenue</div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class='c021'><span class='sc'>Chicago</span>, August 15, 1910.</div>

<p class='c017'><i>Mr. John Smith, Godfrey’s Corners, Ia.</i></p>

<p class='c017'><span class='sc'>Dear Sir</span>: Not having heard from you in response to my letter
of August 2d, I am reluctantly forced to the conclusion that conditions
are such as to make your coming to Chicago impossible. This
is a matter of sincere regret to me as the case appears to be one of
peculiar interest and, as a physician, I would like to have opportunity
of advising myself more fully as to the exact conditions.</p>

<p class='c017'>If you will send me the name and address of your family physician
I will write him asking for the necessary information, and between
us we may be able to do something for you at your home. While
your letter is unusually full and complete, with the facts stated in
an intelligent manner not customary with laymen, you will readily
understand that there are some complications in nearly every case
which are more readily described by a physician, and especially one
who has been watching it faithfully for a long time.</p>

<p class='c017'>Hoping to hear from you promptly, I am,</p>
<div class='c021'>Very truly yours,</div>
<div class='c021'>————</div>
<p class='c011'>When Mr. Smith receives this letter about the first
thing he does is to show it to his family doctor and, no
matter how much the latter was opposed to the “new-fangled”
treatment at first, his chest swells with pride at
the flattering reference to his ability. He says:</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, Mr. Smith, you may send my name and address
to Dr. Wilkinson and when I hear from him I will write
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>him fully about your case. He is right in saying that
only a professional man can give the required information
properly.”</p>

<p class='c012'>And off marches Mr. Family Physician, head erect,
and with the pompous air of a drum major. Is he not
about to be consulted by the famous Dr. Wilkinson, a
man known throughout the land for his wonderful successes?</p>

<p class='c012'>When the specialist receives the local doctor’s name
and address from Mr. Smith, he writes the doctor somewhat
after this style:</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c020'>
    <div>G. H. WILKINSON, M.D.</div>
    <div class='c000'>SPECIALIST IN CHRONIC DISEASES</div>
    <div class='c000'>—— Michigan Avenue</div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class='c021'><span class='sc'>Chicago</span>, August 21, 1910.</div>

<p class='c017'><i>Thomas H. Jennings, M.D., Godfrey’s Corners, Ia.</i></p>

<p class='c017'><span class='sc'>Dear Doctor</span>: I have lately been consulted by mail by Mr. John
Smith, of your city, who is, I understand, a patient of yours
suffering from tabes dorsalis. The case appears to be one of unusual
interest and I will be under obligation to you professionally
if you will make me acquainted with the details.</p>

<p class='c017'>As you have been in charge of the case a long time it would be
presumptuous on my part to attempt to outline the facts I want.
You will know what to write about a great deal better than I would,
and I will leave the matter entirely in your hands. My only interest
in the matter now is a professional one as I understand Mr. Smith
is unable to come to Chicago.</p>

<p class='c017'>Trusting that you will accommodate me, and hoping that I may
be able to return the favor in kind, I am,</p>
<div class='c021'>Yours fraternally,</div>
<div class='c021'>————</div>

<p class='c011'>This does settle Mr. Family Physician for sure. For
years afterward he takes delight in letting it be known
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>how he was “called into consultation by the eminent Dr.
Wilkinson, of Chicago, who said frankly that I knew
more about the case than he did.” To the credit of Mr.
Family Physician be it said that this latter statement was
probably correct, and it might with all truth have been
extended to include the assertion that he was doing as
much or more for the patient as Dr. Wilkinson could.</p>

<p class='c012'>At any rate Dr. Wilkinson receives the information he
asks for, and beyond returning a brief note of thanks to
the local doctor and saying that he will give the matter
thorough attention as soon as he gets a little respite from
his rush of duties, that is the end of it for the time being.</p>

<p class='c012'>But Dr. Wilkinson is not idle. He is conducting, or
rather his secretary is, a similar correspondence with
scores of other physicians and prospective patients.
From the letters thus received a card system is arranged,
all the “prospects” being grouped by localities.</p>

<p class='c012'>One day Dr. Wilkinson finds that he has some fifty
good “prospects” in the immediate vicinity of some good
town, and decides to make a round up. He then writes,
either to the prospective patients in that neighborhood,
or the physicians, if his correspondence with the latter
has been encouraging, a letter somewhat as follows:</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c020'>
    <div>G. H. WILKINSON, M.D.</div>
    <div class='c000'>SPECIALIST IN CHRONIC DISEASES</div>
    <div class='c000'>—— Michigan Avenue</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'><i>Thomas H. Jennings, M.D., Godfrey’s Corners, Ia.</i></p>

<p class='c017'><span class='sc'>Dear Doctor Jennings</span>: Since the receipt of your letter relative
to the case of Mr. Smith I have been called to —— for consultation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>in a serious case. I will be at the —— hotel on Thursday
next but will be very busy, and do not think it safe to make
any engagements, aside from the consultation, for that day. If you
can arrange to meet me on Friday (the following day) between 10
and 11 a.m., I will remain over. I suggest this as it will afford us
an opportunity of discussing Mr. Smith’s case to better advantage
than it is possible to do by mail. There will, of course, be no fee
attached to this service on my part.</p>

<p class='c017'>Kindly let me know at once whether I may expect to have the
pleasure of meeting you so that I may arrange my time accordingly.</p>

<div class='c021'>Yours fraternally,</div>
<div class='c021'>————</div>
<p class='c011'>Dr. Jennings is impressed by the compliment thus paid
him by the eminent specialist. So are the dozen or more
other physicians to whom Dr. Wilkinson writes, most
of them hastening to make engagements to meet the
specialist at varying hours.</p>

<p class='c012'>If the correspondence has been entirely with the prospective
patient, and no family physician has been enlisted
as an intermediary, the “come on” letter is made to read
differently. In cases of this kind the doctor would say:</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c020'>
    <div>G. H. WILKINSON, M.D.</div>
    <div class='c000'>SPECIALIST IN CHRONIC DISEASES</div>
    <div class='c000'>—— Michigan Avenue</div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class='c021'><i>Mr. Thomas Ratcliffe, Eagle Mills, Ia.</i></div>

<p class='c017'><span class='sc'>Dear Sir</span>: Since writing you last I have been called to ——
for consultation in a serious case and will be at the —— hotel on
Thursday next. As I can arrange to have a little leisure I would
suggest that you meet me there at 11 a.m. so that I may be able
to make a satisfactory diagnosis of your case, and thus be in
position to advise you intelligently as to the prospects for obtaining
relief.</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>I feel free to make this suggestion as there will be no fee or
charge of any kind for this service all my expenses being guaranteed
by the parties with whom I am to consult.</p>

<p class='c017'>Kindly let me hear from you at once as I have many demands
upon my time and wish to arrange my schedule to the best advantage.</p>

<div class='c021'>Yours very truly,</div>
<div class='c021'>————</div>

<p class='c011'>The fact that he has not been invited to visit ——, or
any other town for consultation purposes does not bother
Dr. Wilkinson. It is one of those “harmless prevarications”
tolerated and even encouraged, in all professions.
It would not be dignified nor ethical for a doctor to start
out on the road on a hunt for patients. It is not improper,
once having been “called” to another city, to take
advantage of the trip to do a little professional business
on the side.</p>

<p class='c012'>Dr. Wilkinson must have an excuse for visiting ——.
The most plausible excuse is that he has been invited
there in consultation by some brother physician whose
name is withheld.</p>

<p class='c012'>Before the time comes for starting for —— Dr. Wilkinson
has received replies to his letters. Most of these
are favorable, and the doctor is enabled to make out a
time card that will keep him profitably engaged while in
——. This card should read:</p>

<p class='c012'>Before leaving Chicago the doctor will have his secretary
get out the correspondence with each of the “prospects”
and this, each lot enclosed in its own filing packet,
will be put in his suit case or hand valise.</p>

<p class='c012'>Arriving at —— Dr. Wilkinson will arrange with the
hotel clerk to notify him when anybody calls. At 10
a.m. Dr. Jennings will be announced.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Tell him,” Dr. Wilkinson will say to the bell boy,
“that I am very busy just now and must ask him to
excuse me for ten minutes. I will be able to see him
promptly then.”</p>

<p class='c012'>This gives the doctor time to get out the Jennings correspondence
and refresh his mind as to the particulars
of the Smith case. Then he sends word to have Dr. Jennings
shown up.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Sorry to have been compelled to keep you waiting,
doctor,” and a warm cordial handshake, greets the country
physician who is at once impressed with the fine appearance
and friendly manner of his visiting brother.
There is a little preliminary talk about the trip, the
country, the weather, etc., and then the Smith case is
taken up and thoroughly discussed.</p>

<p class='c012'>“If I had time,” says the specialist, “I’d like to see
Smith, but that’s out of the question. Your very clear
and able description of the case has impressed me
strongly. One of these days when I happen to be out
here again with more time on my hands, and the patient
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>is still living, I’ll ask you to take me out to see him. I
understand it’s only a short distance from here.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Just thirty minutes’ ride on the Lincoln branch, doctor,”
replies Jennings. “Why can’t you run out with me
this afternoon? No time like the present, you know.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“The trouble is that I will be busy until 4 p.m., and
then it will be too late.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Not at all. There’s a train at 4:30 and we can be at
Smith’s home by 5. Better go. Barring his ailment
you’ll find Smith a good host. He’s rich and has a fine
home, and the best of everything. I know he’ll be glad
to pay liberally for your opinion whether it is favorable
or unfavorable.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Well, doctor, if you think there is no doubt of my
being able to get back so as to take the 10:30 train for
Chicago I guess I’ll have to go with you. Really I
should not do it as I have a hard day’s work ahead of me,
but you have aroused my interest in the case and I
would like to see the patient. I’ll meet you at the depot
at train time. Until then good bye. I can’t begin to tell
you how much I appreciate your call. If conditions were
different I would insist on your being my guest for the
day, but, as you well know we medical men are not our
own masters.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Without appearing to hurry he gets rid of Dr. Jennings
before it is time to receive the next caller and, by
exercising a little tact, the various people with whom
he has made engagements are kept from meeting one another.
Out of the four appointments he has made with
laymen the doctor will ordinarily obtain fees from at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>least two, if not all four of his callers. Just how he does
it will be explained in another chapter.</p>

<p class='c012'>At 4:15 Dr. Wilkinson is at the depot where he finds
Dr. Jennings waiting. On the train, the specialist delicately
brings up the matter of fees.</p>

<p class='c012'>“One great trouble with a treatment of this kind is the
expense. The fees must necessarily be large and it is
difficult to get even wealthy men to pay them. It is a
relief to be able to discuss this part of the subject candidly
with a brother physician like yourself who has
the brain and common sense to appreciate it.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Once again Dr. Jennings is pleased at the confidence
reposed in him, and the more so when Dr. Wilkinson
continues:</p>

<p class='c012'>“Of course in a case like this where the local physician
interests himself, takes his time to visit a patient with the
specialist, gives the latter the benefit of his knowledge of
the case, and continues the treatment after the specialist
has gone, there should be a division of the fee. The
local physician cannot be expected to donate his services;
that would be ridiculously unfair.”</p>

<p class='c012'>The country doctor is more interested than ever.
Should he be super-sensitive about acceptance of a fee,
and inclined to question the ethics of the arrangement he
is quieted with the assurance that it is in common practice
all over the country. In most cases, however, there is
no tendency of this kind. The local practitioner is ready,
and anxious to get his share of the money. His main
concern is about the amount. Frequently he asks:</p>

<p class='c012'>“What do you think we can get doctor?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“That depends upon the man. You know him better
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>than I do. You say he is wealthy, so his ability to pay
is not to be questioned. We’ll fix upon an amount that
will be equitable under the circumstances. It should
not be less than $500.”</p>

<p class='c012'>The prospect of obtaining $250 so easily is very alluring
to Dr. Jennings. He does not realize that the specialist
is using him as a bait, making him stand sponsor
as it were, for the merit and efficiency of the treatment.
Arrived at Smith’s home Dr. Jennings is warm in his endorsement
of everything Dr. Wilkinson says and does.
The latter examines the patient carefully, asks him numerous
questions, frequently referring to Dr. Jennings for
information upon technical points, and showing deference
for the opinions of the family physician. Finally the
stage is reached where it is necessary to talk business.</p>

<p class='c012'>“If you should decide to take this treatment, Mr.
Smith, I will arrange with Dr. Jennings for its administration.
It should be given twice a day. I will furnish
all the remedies and, advised by frequent letters from Dr.
Jennings as to your progress, will outline such changes
from time to time as may appear necessary.”</p>

<p class='c012'>This naturally leads Mr. Smith up to asking, “Do you
think you can cure me, doctor?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Well, Mr. Smith, as Dr. Jennings will tell you no reputable
physician countenances the word ‘cure.’ I will
say, however, that I have had many cases, some of them
apparently even worse than yours, in which entirely satisfactory
results have been obtained. Here are a couple
of letters just received which I am requested by the
writers to show. They will probably interest you.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Saying this the specialist brings out a couple of letters
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>written by patients who have been benefited. They are
bona fide letters. It would be strange if out of the large
number of people treated some cases did not yield satisfactory
results. The letters read about as follows:</p>
<div class='c023'><span class='sc'>Pittsburgh</span>, ——, 1910.</div>

<p class='c017'><span class='sc'>Dear Doctor Wilkinson</span>: Replying to your enquiry of recent
date regarding my condition I am most happy to be able to say that
marked improvement continues. The pains have entirely disappeared,
all the functions of the body are normal, and I walk long
distances every day without cane or crutch. This result obtained
in a little less than ten months of treatment is most pleasing considering
that I was sorely afflicted for over ten years, and that my
case was pronounced incurable by the best specialists both here and
abroad. Dr. Kennedy, my family physician, says the change in my
condition is miraculous.</p>

<p class='c017'>Don’t hesitate to show this letter to those who may be similarly
afflicted. It is a duty which I feel that I owe humanity to make
known what has been done for me.</p>

<p class='c017'>You will probably also hear from Dr. Kennedy within a few days.
With sincere thanks, I am,</p>

<div class='c021'>Most gratefully yours,</div>
<div class='c021'>————</div>
<p class='c011'>Drowning men clutch at straws. Mr. Smith knows
that he is afflicted with an ailment which other physicians
have been unable to relieve. Here appears to be something
effective. Hope dawns, and he enquires:</p>

<p class='c012'>“What will it cost, doctor?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“That, my dear sir, is a question I was in hopes you
would not ask. Worry over the expense of treatment
always tends to retard or delay complete recovery. What
is money compared with health. Why should you set
one against another? Can you measure the monetary
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>value of health as you would that of a ton of coal, or a
ton of hay?”</p>

<p class='c012'>Mr. Smith begins to feel ashamed of himself, and all
the more so when his family physician chimes in and endorses
what the visiting specialist has said:</p>

<p class='c012'>“I guess that’s all right, doctor,” responds Smith. “You
can’t measure health against money, but I must have
some idea as to the expenses. It may be beyond my
means.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“We’ll fix that all right,” says Dr. Wilkinson. “The
usual fee for complete treatment is $150 a month.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“How long will it take?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“That’s something no man can tell. I’ve had cases
in which the desired results were obtained in so short a
time as four months, and others in which they were deferred
for fifteen months. If there is such a thing as
striking an average I should name it at ten months.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“That would be $1,500. That’s an awful lot of
money.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“It’s nothing in comparison with good health. I have
had many patients who preferred to pay a lump fee in
advance in order to get the worry about money details
off their minds. Under this arrangement the treatment
is continued as long as may be necessary whether it is
four months or fourteen. In such cases I accept $1,000.
This not only pays for the entire course of treatment but
it saves the patient $500 should the course be continued
for ten months, which is not at all unlikely.”</p>

<p class='c012'>The saving of $500 appeals to Mr. Smith, and he accepts
the proposition. While he is signing the check Dr. Jennings
has to pinch himself to see if he is really awake.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>The idea of getting $500 for his share of an hour’s talk
is overpowering. The check delivered, Mr. Smith is assured
that the remedies will be in Dr. Jennings’ possession
within the week and that treatment will start at
once.</p>

<p class='c012'>Once outside Dr. Jennings is impelled to ask: “How
did you come to fix the fee at $1,000, doctor? I thought
you said it would be $500?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I said not less than $500. But I found Mr. Smith
more responsive in this connection than most men, and
it was just as easy to get $1,000 as it would have been
$500. By the way, how are we going to divide this
check?”</p>

<p class='c012'>There is nothing to do but for Dr. Wilkinson to remain
in town over night and for Dr. Jennings to identify
him at the bank the next day. This is done, and the
money drawn and divided. Who gets the best of the bargain?
Apparently both doctors are on the same footing,
but are they? Dr. Wilkinson has $500. For this
he will send once a month for a few months a supply of
treatment the actual cost of which will not exceed $2.50
a month—perhaps $25 for ten months. Dr. Jennings, on
the other hand, must visit the patient every day, administer
the treatment, keep track of his condition, note
such changes as may occur, and report them to Dr.
Wilkinson.</p>

<p class='c012'>Dr. Jennings must perform his duty in person, he cannot
delegate it to another. Dr. Wilkinson does most of
his work, except the actual case taking, through hired
help. He has a dozen, or a hundred, Dr. Jennings working
for him all the time.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>Many specialists are averse to working in connection
with family physicians. In some instances this is because
of short-sightedness on the part of the specialist.
He doesn’t like the idea of dividing his fee with the
country practitioner. In other words he is greedy and
wants it all, losing sight of the fact that in the great majority
of instances the family physician is the deciding
arbiter and, without his aid, a lot of cases would be
lost.</p>

<p class='c012'>Then there are specialists who have not the knack
of making friends with the country doctor. The latter is
naturally opposed to the specialist; he thinks, whether
justly or not, that his own method is best and looks
askance on “new-fangled” ideas in practice, especially
when a good fee is liable to go to the stranger. But, let
this same country physician be led up in the proper manner
to the division of fee proposition and he takes a different
view of the situation. It seems like a lot of
money to give away, but it is a good investment. The
man who accepts the division stands committed to the
treatment; he becomes a booster instead of a knocker.
If the case does not turn out well there is little chance
to find fault with the specialist. The local Dr. Jennings
has been in charge and upon his shoulders rests the responsibility.
Should the patient complain the local
physician can, and very likely will say:</p>

<p class='c012'>“Of course it is a disappointment Mr. Smith, but the
practice of medicine is full of disappointments. There
is one consolation. You have had the benefit of the
latest treatment evolved by medical science. Dr. Wilkinson
arranged the treatment to meet your special needs
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>after I had given him a complete history of your case,
and you must admit that I have been faithful in its administration.
I’m sorry that the results were not different,
but that is something every physician has to
contend with.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Left without the services of the local physician as an
ally the specialist would probably be blamed for the
failure, and the patient might even refer to him as a
swindler. Such things have occurred with the result that
the specialist’s chance of getting any more patients in
that neighborhood was wiped out. But, by retaining the
services of the family physician the specialist is taking
out insurance against this very happening.</p>

<p class='c012'>Dr. Jennings, of course, does not realize that he is
being made a buffer of. He has had, as he thinks, the
scientific features of the treatment carefully explained
to him, and the theory is reasonable and in thorough accord
with that of accepted authorities. As for the division
of fee—why he certainly is entitled to pay for his
services in treating Mr. Smith, and it is much better for
the latter to have Dr. Wilkinson stand this expense than
for it to fall upon Mr. Smith.</p>

<p class='c012'>It’s all in the viewpoint, and the viewpoint can be
just what the specialist makes it. If he is a clever man
it will be favorable; if he lacks tact and is antagonistic
in nature, it will be unfavorable. As to this latter contingency
it may well be said that a tactless, antagonistic
man has no business operating in this field. Tact and
suavity and an impressive appearance count far more
than a knowledge of medicine, and will get more money
every time.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>It’s worth considerable to have the good will of family
physicians in the country districts, so that when occasion
arises they will say: “Dr. Wilkinson is an able man,
and perfectly square in his business methods. We (observe
the “we”) didn’t get the desired results in the
Smith case, but it must be remembered that it was an
unusually serious one, and Dr. Wilkinson said so at the
time. Recovery would have been little short of a miracle.
Had the treatment been taken before the disease
was so far advanced there is every reason to believe the
results would have been different.”</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>
  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER VI<br /> <br /><b>RECEPTION OF OFFICE PATIENTS</b></h2>
</div>
<p class='c011'>To the physician who prefers to do a strictly office
practice, making few or no professional forays into the
country, well located, neatly furnished, attractive quarters
are a necessity. Three rooms will be sufficient for a
start. These should include a reception room, waiting
parlor, and doctor’s private office.</p>

<p class='c012'>Size is not so important as location and furnishings.
The quarters should be in a modern building of high-class
reputation as to the character of its tenants. If
the arrangement is such as to give an entrance into the
doctor’s room from the waiting parlor, and an exit into
another hall, it is preferable. This will make possible
the separation of the callers the doctor has seen from
those who are still waiting, and this prevents a lot of talk
which may have a harmful tendency.</p>

<p class='c012'>People, especially men, waiting to see a physician are
apt to get into conversation with one another. When
there is only one door serving as entrance and exit to
the private office, and a caller, after seeing the physician,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>has to come back into the waiting parlor in order to get
out there is a temptation to stop for a few moments and
chat with those who are still waiting. In this way much
harm, particularly in the matter of fees, may be done.</p>

<p class='c012'>It is poor policy to give people a chance to exchange
confidences. They will tell each other their opinion of
the physician, the amount of the fees, etc. If these latter
do not agree in amount it causes jealousies and distrust,
and it becomes difficult in many cases for the physician
to explain to the satisfaction of Mr. Brown why he should
be charged a larger fee than Mr. Jones.</p>

<p class='c012'>Under the best of conditions there will be too much of
this sort of thing, but it may be greatly reduced by an
arrangement of the rooms which will admit of callers being
taken into the doctor’s office at one door and shown
out at another. In one instance the waiting room of a
certain specialist was crowded when one of the callers
came out from the office after an interview.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Are you going to take the treatment,” was the question
put to him by one of those with whom he had been
talking before he had seen the doctor.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Not much,” was the answer in a loud tone. “That
man’s a robber. He wanted $500 for the treatment.”</p>

<p class='c012'>This frightened away a number of men nearly all of
whom would have been good for $100 apiece when interviewed
by the doctor under proper conditions. But
they left without seeing him; actually scared off by the
talk of the dissatisfied caller.</p>

<p class='c012'>Rooms arranged as described and located in a good
building will command more rental than ordinary
quarters, but the investment will be a good one. There
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>will be more money in paying $100 or $150 a month for
rooms of this kind than $50 for others not similarly arranged.</p>

<p class='c012'>Proper furnishings create a favorable impression upon
callers. Neat rugs, comfortable leather covered chairs
and lounges, neat tables for books and magazines, handsome
curtains and bright, cheerful pictures on the wall
tend to make the extraction of a good-sized fee all the
easier.</p>

<p class='c012'>No person feels like paying a big fee to a doctor of
sloppy appearance who is quartered in a shabby, poorly
furnished room. Shabby surroundings breed distrust.
An appearance of prosperous solidity on the other hand
creates confidence. It is easier to get $100 from a patient
in properly furnished quarters than it is to get
$5 when the doctor’s poverty stares out from every side.</p>

<p class='c012'>One of the most successful specialists in the profession
had retired with a competence. He got to speculating
and lost heavily. When he had only $1,000 left he was
compelled to resume practice. He rented quarters which
cost him $125 a month, and furnished them magnificently
at a cost of $1,250, paying $500 down. Various other
outlays cut his cash capital down to $100 by the time he
was ready to open his offices. Did he flinch? Not at
all. He was game and knew that with any ordinary
luck it would be a paying investment. He made a second
fortune which he was wise enough to keep.</p>

<p class='c012'>“It was like catching flies with a bait of sugar,” he
said in discussing his method. “They swarmed in from
all sides; the surroundings looked right, and I had little
trouble in landing a fair percentage of the callers. If I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>had attempted to skimp in the rent or furnishings my
purpose would have been defeated from the start.”</p>

<p class='c012'>In taking medical treatment, as in nearly everything
else, people like to deal with the successful man, and
they judge of a man’s success by his surroundings. If
he looks prosperous the battle is half won before the
attack on the caller’s pocketbook begins.</p>

<p class='c012'>Next to the location and furnishings of the office, and
the neat, well-dressed appearance of the physician himself,
comes the question of the selection of the proper
reception room girl. Here almost as much tact is needed
as in the physician’s private office. The right kind of
girls are scarce, and when one is found she is worth
much more money than the average doctor, unacquainted
with the importance of the position, is willing to pay.
A thoroughly competent girl is easily worth from $18 to
$25 a week, yet most doctors grumble at paying $10 or
$12.</p>

<p class='c012'>It is a peculiar combination of talent, one exceedingly
hard to find, that is required. The successful attendant
must be prepossessing in appearance, a neat dresser, intelligent,
sympathetic, chummy to a degree without being
“fresh,” and, above all, must have that undefinable
quality known as tact. She must have the knack of making
people feel at home and comfortable on their first and
all subsequent visits, without being fussy or over-prominent
in her attentions.</p>

<p class='c012'>Quiet dignity and charm of manner in a reception
room girl is a combination of great value to an employer.
The girl possessed of these qualities, in addition to
“tact,” can be a valuable and powerful ally of the physician.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>She will exert a great influence in keeping patients
good natured and satisfied, steer the malcontents
away from opportunity to make trouble, and preserve in
general the harmony that should prevail in the professional
family.</p>

<p class='c012'>We all know what a strong factor first impression is.
The manner of our reception by a stranger invariably
sows the seed of our opinion. If the reception is courteous
and kindly without being effusive we are won; if it
is cold and indifferent, or so overly effusive that deceit
is apparent, we are repelled. Right here is where the reception
room attendant wins or loses. It makes all
the difference in the world whether the prospective patient
meets the doctor for the first time pleased with the
manner in which he was received, or whether he is
fretted or annoyed at his treatment in the outer office.</p>

<p class='c012'>The door leading from the reception room into the
waiting parlor should always be kept closed. There is
no necessity of letting the people who are waiting to see
the doctor hear what is going on in the outer room.
It often works harm. Besides this a new comer will announce
himself more freely to the attendant when alone
with her than he will when a dozen or more strangers are
within hearing.</p>

<p class='c012'>One of the furnishings of the reception, or outer room,
unless the business warrants a separate department, may
be an unobtrusive cabinet in which the correspondence
is filed. This should always be closed so callers will not
get an idea as to its contents. Men especially do not like
to know that a woman is conversant with the contents
of their letters to the doctor.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>When a stranger enters the room the attendant should
always rise from her desk, meet him half way, and enquire
pleasantly:</p>

<p class='c012'>“What can I do for you?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I’d like to see the doctor.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Step into the waiting room, please, and I’ll let him
know you are here. Whom shall I announce?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Thomas Carroll, of Providence, Iowa. I think he expects
me as I’ve had some correspondence with him.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“All right, Mr. Carroll, I will let him know you are
here.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Taking the new comer into the waiting room the attendant
should give him a paper or periodical. The man
who is reading is not so apt to get into conversation with
strangers as the one who is idle. Coming back into the
outer office the girl closes the door, goes at once to the
correspondence cabinet and takes out the packet containing
Mr. Carroll’s correspondence. This she gives
to the doctor via the outside door, at the same time announcing
Mr. Carroll’s arrival.</p>

<p class='c012'>No doctor who is wise will receive a caller immediately
upon arrival. It creates a good impression to keep the
caller waiting for a few moments even if there is nobody
ahead of him. The girl goes back to the waiting room
and says:</p>

<p class='c012'>“The doctor is glad to know you are here, Mr. Carroll.
He is engaged with a patient just now, but he will be
through very soon, and will see you in a few minutes.”</p>

<p class='c012'>This helps to kill time, and to convince the caller that
the attendant is looking after his interests. In the meantime
the doctor is reading Mr. Carroll’s letters and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>answers thereto, and refreshing his memory about the
case so that when Mr. Carroll is shown in the latter will
be astonished by the doctor’s knowledge of his ailment
and condition. The letters in the meantime are put
away in a drawer out of sight.</p>

<p class='c012'>Finally the bell rings and, if Mr. Carroll is next on the
list, the girl will say:</p>

<p class='c012'>“The doctor will see you now, Mr. Carroll,” and shows
him into the sanctum. What happens when doctor and
caller come together is told in another chapter. This
one deals solely with the manner in which the caller
should be received by the girl in charge of the outer office.</p>

<p class='c012'>Should the caller become a patient the attendant who
understands her duty will begin to evince a mild ladylike
interest in his case. Without at any time becoming
forward or fresh she will have a cheery word of greeting
for him on his daily arrival or departure, and finally begin
to comment in a delicate manner on the improvement
in his appearance.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Good morning, Mr. Carroll. You’re looking better this
morning. By the way, if you want to write any letters
you can dictate them to our stenographer, and you might
as well have your mail sent here. I’ll be glad to look
after it for you.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Such attentions mean much to an invalid stranger and
are more appreciated than they would be by a robust,
healthy person. Mr. Carroll may intimate that he thinks
of going to some theater in the evening, but doesn’t
know where to go. Then the attendant should say:</p>

<p class='c012'>“Well, that depends upon what you like. If it’s comedy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>there’s the —— —— at the Continental.
Grand opera at the Richelieu; tragedy at the Shakespeare
and vaudeville at the Boston. If you want to see something
really funny go to the Continental. I’ll have our
stenographer get your ticket when he goes out to
luncheon, and that will save you from being pushed
around in the crowd at the box office.”</p>

<p class='c012'>All this, of course, is after the lapse of a week or so
when Carroll has become a daily caller for treatment,
and begins to think that the doctor is all right himself,
and that the reception room girl is just about as near
right as they make them.</p>

<p class='c012'>No matter how many girl stenographers the doctor
may keep busy in a room further down the hall, there
should always be one young man for what may be called
“show” purposes. Men patients don’t like the idea of
having their physical troubles discussed in letters written
by girls. When the young man stenographer is brought
in to take dictation from a patient the latter not only appreciates
the compliment, but feels confident that his
troubles are known only to one of his own sex.</p>

<p class='c012'>By all means keep the girl stenographers out of sight,
and do not let the male patients know that a woman ever
saw their letters, or the doctor’s replies to those letters.
Adopt exactly the opposite tactics with women patients—keep
the man stenographer under cover.</p>

<p class='c012'>Despite the utmost care there will be times when the
patients will get together in the waiting room and discuss
the doctor and his methods, the merits or demerits
of the treatment, compare fees, etc. One dissatisfied patient—and
every physician has them, no matter how generally
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>successful he may be—can create more disturbance
and uneasiness in ten minutes than the doctor can overcome
in a week.</p>

<p class='c012'>It is right here that the reception room girl has a
chance to prove her worth. When she finds the conversation
drifting into disagreeable channels she can adroitly
step in and change the subject without seeming to
have a purpose in doing so. The introduction of a
timely topic by a bright, entertaining woman will start
the flow of talk in a new direction and in the discussion
that follows criticism of the doctor will be overlooked.</p>

<p class='c012'>One day a chronic kicker, one of those fellows who is
never satisfied no matter how much is being done for
him, met another patient in the reception room and began
to find fault with the treatment. Without seeming to
listen to the conversation, and with her mind apparently
engrossed on some other topic, the attendant said:</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh my, how I wish I had a brother or a father to advise
me.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Why, what’s the trouble?” very naturally enquired
one of the patients—and he happened to be the “kicker.”</p>

<p class='c012'>The girl went to relate an entirely suppositious occurrence
over which she pretended to be badly wrought
up; a business entanglement with a concern from which
she had bought some goods on the installment plan, and
about which there was a serious misunderstanding.
Both men were profuse in their tenders of advice, and in
their desire to be of assistance to the girl they forgot entirely
the original topic. The girl kept them engaged in
conversation until the “kicker” departed, and the danger
was over for that day, at least.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>She reported the matter to the doctor and the latter
very cleverly arranged the “kicker’s” hours for treatment
so there would be little chance of his finding other
patients in the office.</p>

  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER VII<br /> <br /><b>THE CORRESPONDENCE FILE</b></h2>
</div>
<p class='c011'>No specialist, or physician who conducts a general
practice by publicity methods, can hope to make a lasting
success, except in rare instances, without a well-managed
correspondence department. In the beginning the
physician may attend to this himself but, as the business
grows he will need the services of a smart, competent
man. Newspaper men do the best in this position. The
right kind of men command from $50 to $100 a week, and
in many cases get a working interest in the business.
They are worth every cent they get.</p>

<p class='c012'>The physician with a large office or out-of-town practice
is too busy to give attention to the details of correspondence.
He has not the time during office hours,
and after his work for the day is done he is too weary
to dictate the many letters that should go out every day.
Not only this, but there are very few medical men who
know just what to say. Letter writing is a gift, and the
men who have this gift make a business of it.</p>

<p class='c012'>Every letter that comes into the office should be indexed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>by the card system and then filed away by number
with the copy of the reply attached. This work, as
well as the opening of the mail and the dictation of
answers, should be done in a room convenient to the
doctor’s office, but away from it far enough so that the
patients will not suspect the connection.</p>

<p class='c012'>A letter arrives from Hiram Oxbow, of Valparaiso, Indiana.
The man in charge of the correspondence opens
it and finds that, according to the printed heading Mr.
Oxbow is conducting a cooperage plant. The letter runs
about as follows:</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c020'>
    <div>HIRAM OXBOW</div>
    <div class='c000'>MANUFACTURER OF COOPERAGE</div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class='c021'><span class='sc'>Valparaiso, Ind.</span>, August 10, 1910.</div>

<p class='c017'><i>Dr. G. H. Wilkinson, Chicago, Ill.</i></p>

<p class='c017'><span class='sc'>Dear Sir</span>: I have read of your success in the treatment of locomotor
ataxia, and would like to know whether you think you can
do anything for me. I am 45 years of age, and have been afflicted
for the last eight years. Have doctored with nearly everybody in
the country without results. Can you cure locomotor ataxia?
Please let me hear from you soon.</p>

<div class='c021'>Yours respectfully,</div>
<div class='c021'><span class='sc'>Hiram Oxbow</span>.</div>
<p class='c011'>Sorting out all the letters of this kind the correspondence
chief gives them to one of his stenographers with instructions
to look up the financial rating of the various
writers as given in Dun’s or Bradstreet’s. Every well-equipped
correspondence room will have a copy of a
commercial guide of this kind. The girl marks on the
letters such ratings as are given in the guide. Mr. Oxbow,
for instance, is quoted as A 4.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>When the answers are written each new enquirer is
given an individual card and number, the numbers running
consecutively. The last number in the file we will
say is 6345. Mr. Oxbow’s number will be 6346. One of
the girls then makes out a card which reads:</p>
<p class='c024'>No. 6346—Hiram Oxbow, Valparaiso, Ind.       Rating A 4.</p>

<p class='c025'>1907</p>
<p class='c025'>Aug. 11. First enquiry. Answered with No. 3.</p>
<p class='c011'>Mr. Oxbow’s letter with a carbon copy of the reply
thereto is then placed in a manila paper pocket, numbered
6346, and filed in the letter cabinet. If at any time
it is desired to get the correspondence in the Oxbow case
the card, which is filed alphabetically, will give the correspondence
number and the location of the letters themselves
will then be easy.</p>

<p class='c012'>An entry in brief is made on the card every time Mr.
Oxbow is heard from so that the card itself will show
at all times an outline of the status of the case. Suppose
that a number of letters pass, and Mr. Oxbow finally decides
to come to Chicago to see the doctor. The card
will then show entries like these:</p>
<p class='c024'>No. 6346—Hiram Oxbow, Valparaiso, Ind.       Rating A 4.</p>

<p class='c025'>1907</p>

<p class='c025'>Aug. 10. First enquiry. Answered with No. 3.</p>

<p class='c025'>Aug. 15. Wants more particulars. Asked him to come to Chicago.</p>

<p class='c025'>Aug. 21. Enquires about fees. Told him it was impossible to fix amount in advance of seeing patient.</p>

<p class='c025'>Aug. 26. Will be in Chicago Aug. 30th, 9 a.m.</p>

<p class='c012'>Every letter received from Mr. Oxbow and a copy of
every reply is filed in the same manila pocket so that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>when wanted they are all together, and can be taken out
in a minute.</p>

<p class='c012'>Suppose Mr. Oxbow is not rated in Dun or Bradstreet?
It is the correspondence chief’s business to ascertain
his financial standing if it is possible to do so.
Frequently this is done through the doctor’s bank, or the
doctor may be a subscriber to some commercial agency.
In either event a confidential enquiry is made as to the
responsibility of Mr. Oxbow. The answer may say:
“Good for $10,000;” or “credit good, pays bills promptly;”
or “credit poor.” In the great majority of cases information
of some kind will be secured which can be entered
on the cards for future reference.</p>

<p class='c012'>How are enquiries from prospective patients secured?
Some of them are made voluntarily, being induced by the
enquirer having read in some city paper about the doctor’s
success in certain lines of practice—one of those
articles which the clever press agent, who is usually the
correspondence chief, has had inserted in the guise of
news. Generally, however, enquiries are drawn out by
a systematic campaign through the mails, or by resort
to publication in the country papers.</p>

<p class='c012'>No wide-awake, progressive correspondence chief will
wait for voluntary enquiries. He will make an arrangement
with a clipping bureau by which for $5 a hundred
he will be supplied with clippings from all the papers,
large and small, in his territory announcing the illness of
citizens. When the Beeville <i>Bugle</i> publishes the news
that “Abner Skeets, a prominent resident of Beeville,
has become a victim of chronic arthritis,” the paper is not
in the office of the clipping bureau over a few hours before
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>the correspondence chief has received the paragraph.
In this manner he comes into possession of hundreds of
similar news items every week.</p>

<p class='c012'>All the various publicity articles which the city papers
have published about Dr. Wilkinson and his wonderful
success have been reproduced by the zinc-etching process
and thousands of slips printed in a manner which makes
them bear the appearance of having been torn out of the
original publications.</p>

<p class='c012'>As fast as the clippings come in Mr. Press Agent sorts
them by towns and has one of his stenographers make a
card index, giving the name and address of each prospect
and the nature of his disease, as well as the date of mailing
the first clipping. Then he has plain envelopes addressed
to each prospect, and encloses in these envelopes
one of the prepared news items applicable to the ailment
with which the party addressed is afflicted. There is
no printed business card on these envelopes and, as they
are invariably addressed by hand, the recipient is under
the impression that the communication has been sent by
some unknown friend who desires to let him know of this
doctor’s success in the treatment of just such cases. The
recipient does not connect the doctor with the sending
of the clipping as he argues that, if it came from a doctor,
the envelope would bear his business address, and
there would be some note of explanation. Besides, there
is not one chance in a million that Dr. Wilkinson ever
heard of him, or knows where he lives, or what the nature
of his trouble is. Of course it was sent by some friend.</p>

<p class='c012'>This method excites the curiosity of the sufferer, and
he gives careful attention to the clipping and begins to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>ask himself whether it is not worth while to write to
this wonderful physician and ask his advice about treatment.</p>

<p class='c012'>As fast as a batch of clippings is sent out the cards
from which the addresses were taken are moved to the
back of the receptacle, and a date card, a little higher
than the others and of a different color so as to be readily
noticeable, is placed in front of them. This date card
shows when, if no reply is received to the first communication,
it will be in order to send a second.</p>

<p class='c012'>If the first communications are mailed on the 10th of
the month, the date card behind which these cards are
placed will bear date of the 30th, thus showing that on
the 30th of the month another clipping, or some other
form of literature should be sent.</p>

<p class='c012'>Whenever one of the parties thus addressed is heard
from this card is given a file number and transferred to
the prospective list, the purport of the enquiry and the
nature of the reply being noted on it. There is never
lack of material to work on. People who have heard of
the doctor are writing to him all the time, and the clipping
bureau is continually sending in items about people
in various parts of the country who have become afflicted
with serious chronic troubles.</p>

<p class='c012'>Every physician who practises in this manner should
have a neat pamphlet descriptive of his treatment and the
results obtained in various ailments. It is the duty of
the press agent or correspondence chief to prepare this.
It should be modest in language and give an outline of
the pathology of certain diseases as well as the therapeutic
effects of the treatment in a rational, plausible
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>manner. Exaggerated statement, or defects in technical
description will defeat its purpose. The typography
must be neat and in good taste, and the paper of high
quality.</p>

<p class='c012'>Right here it may be stated that many physicians are
penny wise and pound foolish in the matter of literature
and stationery. The best is none too good. Neat, handsome
work attracts attention, while the cheap, slip-shod
variety repels.</p>

<p class='c012'>If the clipping first sent has not brought an enquiry
by the tenth day, mail one of the pamphlets. The recipient
will read this with interest and note particularly
what has been accomplished in cases strikingly similar
to his own. On mailing the pamphlet the fact should be
entered on the card, with date of mailing, and the card
moved back another ten days, ready to be taken up again
on the 30th. By this system there is a constant stream
of mail matter going out every day, and each card contains
a record of just what printed matter has been sent
to each prospect, and when.</p>

<p class='c012'>Allowing that neither the newspaper item or the
pamphlet bring enquiries Mr. Press Agent will, as his
third effort, address the sufferer by letter somewhat as
follows:</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c020'>
    <div>G. H. WILKINSON, M.D.</div>
    <div class='c000'>SPECIALIST IN CHRONIC DISEASES</div>
    <div class='c000'>—— Michigan Avenue</div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class='c021'><span class='sc'>Chicago</span>, Sept. 9, 1910.</div>

<p class='c017'><i>Mr. John Peters, Beeville, Wisconsin.</i></p>

<p class='c017'><span class='sc'>Dear Sir</span>: Recently, at the suggestion of a mutual friend, I mailed
to your address a copy of a pamphlet containing an account of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>what has been accomplished in the treatment of cases similar to
yours by an entirely new method. This I hope you have received
and had time to read over carefully as I am confident you will find
it of interest.</p>

<p class='c017'>The gentleman referred to (who requests that his name be withheld)
has told me considerable about your case—just enough to
arouse professional curiosity. This is my only excuse for intruding
upon you. If you will kindly forward details, stating length of
illness, nature of symptoms, what has been accomplished in the way
of treatment, etc., I may be able to use the information to the
benefit of others similarly afflicted.</p>

<p class='c017'>Should I be able to offer any suggestions or advice which may
tend to improve your condition, I shall be glad to do so. For this
there will be no fee or charge of any kind—it will be merely exchanging
one favor for another.</p>

<div class='c021'>Yours very truly,</div>
<div class='c021'><span class='sc'>G. H. Wilkinson</span>, M.D.</div>
<p class='c011'>No appeal here to come in and be relieved of a big
fee; no intimation that the doctor would like to have
Mr. Peters as a pay patient. On the contrary the doctor
only seeks information that may be of benefit to other
patients. At least this is the way Mr. Peters interprets
it.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Fine fellow, that doctor,” says Mr. Peters as he reads
the letter, and he sits him down “with pen in hand” to
describe his case, invariably winding up with an enquiry
as to whether the doctor thinks there is any hope for
him. The reply from Mr. Peters is forthcoming all the
quicker because the doctor has thoughtfully enclosed a
plain stamped envelope bearing the written (not printed
or type-written) address, “G. H. Wilkinson, —— Michigan
Ave., Chicago.” No M.D., attached to the title, nothing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>to give the inquisitive hangers-on at the post office in
Beeville a clue to the true nature of the communication.
When these busybodies happen to catch a glimpse of Mr.
Peters’ letter they have no suspicion that it is a doctor
their fellow townsman is writing to. Nothing to show
it on the envelope. No doctor’s return card in the corner,
no printed or even type-written address.</p>

<p class='c012'>No sir-ree. Dr. Wilkinson is too smart for that. Experience
has taught him that the average man does not
like to have his friends and neighbors know that he is
corresponding with a strange doctor. Hence the
“sent-securely-sealed-in-plain-package tactics.”</p>

<p class='c012'>It’s different in a big town or city where the facilities
for becoming acquainted with the nature of a man’s correspondence
do not exist, and the rush of business is so
great that even postal cards go through the mails unread
by any one except the sender and the receiver.</p>

<p class='c012'>But in the rural districts where Absalom Squash and
Praise-it-all Tompkins assist Hiram Gaylord in his duties
as postmaster to the extent of closely inspecting every
letter that comes in or goes out—why that’s another
story.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Wonder what John Peters is writing to that fellow in
Chicago erbout?” says Absalom Squash as he picks up
the letter addressed to G. H. Wilkinson and holds it up
to the light in a vain effort to get an inkling as to the
contents. But this Wilkinson chap is wise. He has
provided an extra heavy envelope, white on the exterior,
but blue coated inside, to thwart just such efforts.
Against the postal regulations for anybody outside of
the postmaster or his sworn assistants to handle the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>mail? Of course it is. But this regulation is a dead one
in nearly every small post office in the country.</p>

<p class='c012'>When Mr. Squash goes home he reports to Samantha
that “John Peters is writin’ to that Chicago fellow again.
John had a letter from Chicago day before yesterday, and
to-day he sent off the answer, but he didn’t write the address
himself.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“How’d you know ’twas from Peters, then?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“’Cause his boy brought it to the office,” answers
Absalom triumphantly.</p>

<p class='c012'>Samantha is interested and runs over to her friend
Abigail Simpkins to discuss the strange occurrence. That
they are unable to do more than enjoy a little idle gossip
is owing to the lack of any clew on the envelope as to the
nature of the business or occupation of the party addressed.</p>

<p class='c012'>In this feature Dr. Wilkinson’s plan is a good one. In
corresponding with patients or prospective patients use
plain envelopes, or if some safeguard in the matter of
return is desired, use a post-office card in the corner
such as “If not delivered in five days return to Box ——,
Chicago Post Office.” Nothing more. Should anybody
make an effort to ascertain who has rented this particular
box in Chicago, or any other city of decent size, he will
be politely told by the postal officials that it is none of
his business.</p>

<p class='c012'>Sometimes the parties addressed die before the letter
reaches them. In cases of this kind the return card in
the corner of the envelope serves a good purpose. It is
the duty of the postmaster to return it to the address
given in the card marked “Party dead.” When this happens
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>the correspondence chief takes the card from the
file and destroys it. There is no use wasting time, stationery
and postage on dead ones.</p>

<p class='c012'>About five or six forms of these preliminary letters are
prepared, and each is given a number such as No. 1, No.
2, and so on. When they are to be sent out it is not
necessary for the correspondence chief to dictate a letter
to each prospect. He merely sorts out the cards which
are due to be attended to that day and turns them over
to one of the girls to send No. 1, or No. 2, or whatever
letter may be in order.</p>

<p class='c012'>The stenographers have copies of all these letters and,
as they write them, the form number of the letter and the
date of its mailing is entered on the prospect card.
After the list of letters has been exhausted the cards are
transferred to another file to be used later in connection
with the “I have been called to your town” correspondence.
This is a great labor-saving system and makes
possible the transaction of an immense amount of correspondence
at the minimum of expense.</p>

<p class='c012'>Many invalids, especially those who have tried various
forms of treatment without obtaining relief are doubters—they
insist upon “being shown.” They insist upon
some convincing evidence that this special treatment has
merit. This is easy in most instances although once in
a while the specialist runs across a hardened old cuss
who would not believe the Angel Gabriel under oath, and
doesn’t hesitate to say so.</p>

<p class='c012'>Nearly every physician is sure to have some patients
who have been greatly benefited by his treatment and
are truly grateful for the relief obtained. The securing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>of the right kind of letters from these patients is only
a matter of request at the proper psychological moment.
After a friendly talk with one of these patients
some day when the latter is feeling unusually exuberant,
and has deftly been led up to the stage of declaring that
he can never repay the doctor for what he has done for
him, the physician will say:</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, that’s all right, Mr. Brown. I am sincerely
happy to know that the improvement has been so great.
No matter what we do, there is sure to be scoffers and
doubters. But a physician’s hands are tied. There is
no way in which he can overcome this bias except with
the aid of just such men as yourself. Now, if you could
find it convenient to write a letter stating just what has
been done in your case I would keep it in my desk to
show such doubters as may drop in on me. Not as an
advertisement or a puff mind you, but merely as a means
of overcoming unfair statements. But I feel that this
would be asking too much of you.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Not at all, doctor. I’ll be only to glad to do it. But
the fact is doctor, I’m a poor letter writer. If you’ll prepare
something I’ll sign it.”</p>

<p class='c012'>This is just what the doctor wants and at the first
opportunity he slips out and passes the word to the correspondence
chief. The latter prepares a letter which
the doctor copies in his own handwriting. When it is
submitted to Mr. Brown the doctor says:</p>

<p class='c012'>“This will look and read better on one of your own
letter heads. If you will copy it on your stationery I’ll
appreciate the favor.” When finally written and signed
the letter will be about like this:</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>

  </div>
</div>

<div class='c021'><span class='sc'>Chicago</span>, Sept. 9, 1910.</div>

<p class='c017'><span class='sc'>Dear Doctor Wilkinson</span>: I am sure you will be glad to know
that the improvement in my case continues and grows, if anything,
more noticeable daily. Considering the physical wreck I was three
months ago, the change is little short of miraculous. This is not
only my opinion, but that of my friends as well.</p>

<p class='c017'>It is particularly gratifying to have those who called me a fool
when they heard I was going to Chicago to be treated for locomotor
ataxia now acknowledge that they were mistaken, and congratulate
me on my action.</p>

<p class='c017'>If I can serve you in any way don’t hesitate to call upon me.
It is my duty to let fellow-beings similarly afflicted know what you
have done for me.</p>
<div class='c021'>Gratefully yours,</div>
<div class='c021'><span class='sc'>James H. Brown</span>.</div>
<p class='c011'>In the same manner the doctor secures similar letters
from other patients. These are reproduced by the zinc-etching
process, business headings and all, and when
properly printed few people can tell them from the originals.
When copies are sent out to prospective patients
accompanied by the right kind of a letter of explanation
the persons receiving them believe, as a rule, that the
doctor has forwarded for their inspection the correspondence
of Mr. Brown, or some other patient, and this
impression induces many people to return them so the
doctor will not lose such valuable communications.</p>

<p class='c012'>The author, who has long experience in this line, has
had many such letters sent back with notes of thanks for
the privilege of reading them. One of these notes, which
he still retains, reads as follows:</p>
<div class='c023'><span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span><span class='sc'>Oshkosh, Wis.</span>, April 15, 1910.</div>

<p class='c017'><span class='sc'>Dear Doctor</span>: I have read the letters you sent me, with a great
deal of interest, and will say to you frankly that they have convinced
me that there must be a lot of good in your treatment. I am
now making arrangements to come to Chicago, and will do so as
soon as I can close a deal which is now pending and get hold of
some cash.</p>

<p class='c017'>I return the letters as I know you must prize them highly, and
would dislike to lose them.</p>

<p class='c017'>Will write you a day or two before I start, as it will be necessary
to have some one meet me at the depot.</p>

<div class='c021'>Very truly yours,</div>
<div class='c021'>————</div>
<p class='c011'>Did I get this man for a patient? Yes, and he paid
a good fat fee. And the best part of it all is the fact
that, after about three months of treatment, he went back
home comparatively a well man. On his first visit to
the office he was in a wheel chair—he could not walk.
When he left he was able to walk a mile or more without
undue effort.</p>

<p class='c012'>It would defeat the purpose in using these letters from
patients to send them broadcast as circulars. Discretion
must be used as to the manner of distribution. Never
send one until you have had considerable correspondence
with a prospect, and then be careful that duplicates do
not get into the small towns. The smaller the town the
faster the news travels. If John Smith, living in a hamlet
of 300 population, receives communications of this
kind it is only a matter of a few days until everybody in
the place knows of it. Smith tells his wife, his wife
tells somebody else, and in this manner the news is circulated.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>Now, if Aleck Brown, living in the same town, or close
by, should get duplicates of these letters Smith and the
others would soon hear of it and, instead of being looked
upon as priceless treasures submitted for Smith’s inspection,
they would naturally be classed as some new-fangled
method of circular advertising.</p>

<p class='c012'>Having passed several preliminary letters with Mr.
Smith without getting him to commit himself as to coming
in for treatment, pick out a couple of the letters from
patients which apply the most directly to his case, the
particulars of which may be obtained from the prospect
index. Enclose these with a letter of your own addressed
to Mr. Smith, and reading about like this:</p>

<p class='c017'><i>Mr. John Smith, Vail’s Gate, Mich.</i></p>

<p class='c017'><span class='sc'>Dear Sir</span>: In a recent letter you expressed doubt as to the merit
of any treatment that could be applied in a case like yours. In view
of the many disappointments which you have had I cannot criticise
you for holding this opinion. It is a natural one under the circumstances.</p>

<p class='c017'>I am not writing this letter with a view to changing, or attempting
to alter in any way, your decision on this point. You have
probably made up your mind on the subject, and that’s the end of it.</p>

<p class='c017'>Despite this I am positive that you will be interested in the enclosed
letters from former patients in which they express their

After reading these communications I shall be under obligations if
you will kindly return them to me, as I would not like to lose them.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>Again a plain, stamped, hand addressed envelope is
also enclosed so that Mr. Smith may be put to no expense
or trouble in sending back the precious letters, thousands
of copies of which are kept in stock in the doctor’s office.</p>

<p class='c012'>All communications emanating from the office bear the
pen-written signature of the physician in charge, but he
sees very few of them. He is not even conversant with
their contents, except as he may happen to discuss the
subject with his correspondence chief. It is the latter who
directs the correspondence and conducts it in the name
of the physician. He is the business getter of the concern.
It is his duty to get prospective patients coming
into the office; it is the physician’s duty to handle them
after they get there, and to obtain as large a fee as possible
in each instance.</p>

  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER VIII<br /> <br /><b>GETTING AT FINANCIAL STATUS</b></h2>
</div>
<p class='c011'>While, with proper effort and organization, it is possible
to ascertain in advance the financial worth of nearly
every prospect in the manner already outlined, there are
many instances in which this cannot be done through
any of the ordinary channels. Some people conceal their
occupation by writing under an assumed name on plain
paper, so that an enquiry through a commercial agency
will reveal nothing, except, perhaps, the statement “party
unknown.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Others will come in on the physician unheralded, without
any preliminary correspondence. But, if the physician
understands his business, he will get at the facts just
the same as if the callers had introduced themselves with
statements from their bankers showing their financial
rating.</p>

<hr class='c026' />

<p class='c012'>Let us imagine the case of a man who drops into the
office and enquires for the doctor. The reception room
girl will ask his name so that she can announce his arrival.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>“The name doesn’t matter,” says the caller. “The
doctor doesn’t know me.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Have you an appointment for any specific time?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“No. Just dropped in to see the doctor.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Well, the doctor is very busy just now, but he’ll be
disengaged in a few moments. Take a seat please, and
as soon as he is at liberty I’ll let him know you are here.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Don’t overlook this waiting part of the program. It is
important. Creates the impression that the doctor is a
busy man, and that time is valuable. Always keep a
caller waiting at least ten minutes, even if the doctor is
engaged in no more profitable occupation than reading
a magazine. When the caller is finally shown into the
consultation room the doctor receives him with dignified
courtesy and apologizes for having to keep him waiting.</p>

<p class='c012'>This consultation room should be so arranged that,
when doctor and caller are seated facing one another,
the light should fall on the latter’s face, the doctor being
in the shade as it were. This allows of close watch being
kept on the emotions which may play across the
caller’s face, while those which the doctor may not be
able to conceal (these will be few) will pass unnoticed.</p>

<p class='c012'>After the conventional greetings the caller will undoubtedly
outline his case, and ask the doctor for his
opinion.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I must know more about the conditions, Mr. —— by
the way, I didn’t get your name? Robinson. Well, as I
was saying, I must know more about the conditions, Mr.
Robinson, before venturing to give an opinion. I have
many cases strikingly similar in which the results were
all that could be reasonably expected. At the same time,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>as a matter of frankness, I must admit that there are
others in which I have been disappointed.”</p>

<p class='c012'>This apparent candor on the doctor’s part wins the confidence
of the caller and he talks freely, describing his
case in detail. The doctor listens attentively, butting
in with a question only when the caller seems to lag in
his talk. When the ailment and its symptoms have
been fully described the doctor says:</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yours appears to be a somewhat peculiar instance,
Mr. Robinson. There seems to be indications of severe
mental strain or worry. Of course, I may be mistaken,
but that’s the way it looks to me. Have you had any
great domestic or business worries?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“No, sir. Everything is moving along smoothly, both
at home, and in my business.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Frequently a man’s business, Mr. Robinson, involves
a strain which he does not realize. He becomes so accustomed
to its routine that he staggers along with worries
that would crush a man not accustomed to them.
There are some occupations which are a great deal more
trying in this respect than others. One of my patients—of
course it would not be proper to mention his name—is
a banker who was on the verge of insanity when he
came here, through worry over his financial affairs.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, there’s nothing of that kind, no worries I mean,
in my case. My business—I’m a stock dealer—is flourishing.
I’m making money. Cleared $25,000 last year,
have a fine home, a good wife and family, and would enjoy
life if it were not for this annoying trouble. If it
were not for the hope that relief may be found I would
be sorely tempted to kill myself.”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>The secret is out. Unwittingly Mr. Robinson has disclosed
the fact that he is well off financially and able to
pay a good fee, which information is of more importance
to the doctor than the description of the caller’s physical
ills.</p>

<p class='c012'>The conversation drifts back to the ailment, the caller
telling of the various treatments he has taken, and the
results. Among other things, he says:</p>

<p class='c012'>“I have consulted a number of eminent physicians,
among them Drs. —— and ——, and they all
told me that there was no real cure for the trouble.
What do you think, doctor?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Naturally I dislike to set my opinion against that of
the famous men you have mentioned. They are among
the ablest in the profession. Their ability is unquestioned.
Still, we may all be mistaken. In the absence of
a thorough physical examination I would not like to say
positively what the outcome of this treatment would be.
It does seem, however, in view of the success obtained in
similar cases, fully as serious, if not more so, that there
is good reason to feel sanguine.”</p>

<p class='c012'>No promise here. No rough, “Sure thing, I can cure
you,” such as the cheap $5 fakirs indulge in. Nothing of
the kind. The doctor is the very personification of social
and professional dignity. His appearance and manner is
impressive, and the kindly way in which he takes a hidden
clout at those “famous and able specialists” wins the
caller to him.</p>

<p class='c012'>“What would be the fee for an examination, Doctor?”
the caller enquires.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I make no charge for that service,” replies the doctor.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>“It is an essential preliminary to determining
whether the case is one in which the treatment may be
administered with reasonable chance of success. My plan
is to give every applicant a close examination and reject
such cases as appear hopeless. Failures don’t help a
physician’s professional reputation any, so what’s the use
of wasting a man’s time and money when it is a foregone
conclusion that he is beyond help?”</p>

<p class='c012'>This is the clincher. If the caller had any doubt as to
the doctor’s honesty and sincerity this little spiel removes
it. He is going to have that examination made then and
there, fervently praying all the time that the doctor may
find his case one which he would be justified in taking in
charge.</p>

<p class='c012'>But suppose the caller does not broach the subject of
an examination fee, and thus give the doctor an opportunity
to make his stump speech. It matters not. There
are a dozen ways of leading up to the subject without exciting
the suspicions of the caller.</p>

<p class='c012'>“When would it be convenient for you to make this
examination, Doctor?” is a question that naturally follows
from every nine out of ten callers.</p>

<p class='c012'>“There’s no time like the present, Mr. Robinson. It
will take about half an hour, and”—(here the doctor consults
his watch, and opening his engagement book runs
a finger over the record) “Yes, I have just about half an
hour before the next regular patient is due. I suppose
there are some strangers waiting to see me now, but you
are ahead of them. I would make an engagement for
to-morrow were it not that I shall be very busy and will
not have time to give you the proper attention.”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>Mr. Robinson steps behind the screen which stands in
one corner of the reception room, and when he is disrobed
the doctor gives him a very thorough physical examination,
stopping now and then to make notes of the
case. He asks many questions relative to the ailment,
and makes a special feature of testing the sensitive,
super-sensitive and non-sensitive areas with a pair of
callipers. As every medical man knows there are exterior
portions of the human body on which the least bit of
pressure will produce a “flinching” on the part of the patient;
there are others on which considerable pressure
may be applied without noticeable effect.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Why, did that hurt you, Mr. Robinson?” enquires the
doctor as the caller shrinks when the callipers touch a
super-sensitive spot.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Well, yes, a little, Doctor,” is the reply. “Anything
wrong there?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I hope not,” is the doctor’s answer, but he shakes his
head gravely, impressing Mr. Robinson with the belief
that there is more serious trouble than the doctor cares
to admit.</p>

<p class='c012'>After some fifteen minutes of this kind of work the
doctor says:</p>

<p class='c012'>“This is a most peculiar case, Mr. Robinson, but there’s
nothing, so far as I can ascertain, but what may be overcome
by proper treatment. At the same time the conditions
are so unusual that I would like to consult my associate,
Dr. Thompson. Two heads are better than one,
you know. May I call him in? You will then have the
benefit of his opinion as well as mine.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Why certainly, Doctor.”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>Dr. Thompson, who is kept for just this purpose, and
to treat outside patients who are unable to come to the
office, is summoned by electric call, and comes in. He
is a dignified, very professional-looking old chap, neatly
clad in dark Prince Albert suit, and wearing glasses—the
beau ideal of a medical authority.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Mr. Robinson, allow me to introduce Dr. Thompson.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Then to Dr. Thompson: “Doctor I have been examining
Mr. Robinson and the conditions are so unusual
that I would like to have your opinion and see how it
coincides with, or differs from, mine. I think there can
be no question but what it is a pronounced instance of
<i>tabes dorsalis</i>, and yet the conditions are far out of the
ordinary.”</p>

<p class='c012'>During his preliminary talk with Mr. Robinson the
doctor has wormed out of him the fact that his ailment is
locomotor ataxia, so he is taking no chances in committing
himself to the statement that he believes the case
to be a “pronounced instance of <i>tabes</i>.” Besides, this is a
convenient manner of conveying to Dr. Thompson a
“tip” as to what his verdict should be.</p>

<p class='c012'>Together the two doctors go all over Mr. Robinson
again, making comment in professional language as the
examination proceeds. At the end, while Mr. Robinson
is dressing, they sit down together and discuss the conditions
in a subdued tone, but loud enough so as to make
sure that Mr. Robinson will catch the import of the
consultation. When the caller rejoins them Dr. Wilkinson
says:</p>

<p class='c012'>“I am happy to be able to say, Mr. Robinson, that Dr.
Thompson agrees with me fully as to the nature of your
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>ailment, and also that, while the conditions are serious,
there is every reason to expect satisfactory results, provided
proper treatment is administered without further
delay.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Dr. Thompson endorses this in a few well-chosen
words, and then excuses himself on the plea of being very
busy. He will probably retire to the correspondence
room and read a magazine until summoned to play the
same role again with the next caller, but there’s no use
in telling Mr. Robinson so. “Very busy” is always a
trump card in the hands of “eminent” physicians.</p>

<p class='c012'>After Dr. Thompson has left the room Dr. Wilkinson
begins to straighten out the furniture in his office, apparently
as a hint to Mr. Robinson that he is getting
ready to receive another caller. But he is doing nothing
of the kind. He is merely using tactics to bring Mr.
Robinson to the crucial point of declaring that he is going
to take the treatment. Standing up, as if to bid his
caller good bye, the doctor says:</p>

<p class='c012'>“There is one thing I would impress upon you, Mr.
Robinson. Such troubles as yours are not benefited by
delay. The longer you put off treatment the more aggravated
your condition will become, and the more difficult
it will be to accomplish anything in the way of relief.
You should take treatment from some competent physician
right away.”</p>

<p class='c012'>There is no plea here for Dr. Wilkinson’s special
treatment; no solicitation to become a patient of this
particular establishment. Mr. Robinson is still further
impressed with the doctor’s fairness, and also his professional
ability as the diagnosis was the same as that made
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>by other physicians. He does not know that he has told
the doctor of the opinions and findings of the others, and
is therefore all the more strongly inclined to look upon
Dr. Wilkinson as a most remarkable man, a veritable
past master in the profession.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Well, I’d like to take this treatment Doctor, if it
doesn’t cost too much, but I am unable to get away from
my business just now. I must run back home for a couple
of weeks and put my affairs in shape so I can stay
here for a while. How long do you think it will take?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“That’s something I am unable to state definitely. In
some instances, apparently fully as bad, if not worse,
than yours, the desired results have been obtained in
three months; in others these results have been delayed
for six and nine months, and in a few cases even longer.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“What will it cost me, Doctor?”</p>

<p class='c012'>(This subject—fixing the fee—is treated at length in
another chapter—<a href='#ch09'>IX</a>.)</p>

<p class='c012'>There are some specialists who lack tact is ascertaining
a caller’s financial responsibility, or in gaining his
confidence. Their work is so coarse that it repels instead
of attracts. These men rarely, if ever, obtain any
considerable number of patients among well-to-do or intelligent
people. Their practice is invariably cheap, and
$50 fees are few and far between.</p>

<p class='c012'>One specialist of this description opened an office in
Chicago. He was a good physician and his ability
had been recognized by his appointment to important
professorships in various medical colleges and hospitals.
He failed as a specialist because he lacked tact.
If Mr. Robinson had called upon him he would have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>been brusquely received in a cheaply furnished one-room
office, and the money feature would have been uppermost
in the doctor’s talk. Instead of getting the
caller interested in the treatment, by means of a courteous
reception, and strict attention to an examination for
which no charge was made, the itch for money would
have been so apparent that Mr. Robinson could not help
but notice it.</p>

<p class='c012'>Following is an almost verbatim report of the manner
in which a caller was received in the office of this physician.
After a short discussion of the case and before
an examination was made, or even suggested, the caller
asked:</p>

<p class='c012'>“Do you think you can cure me, Doctor?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I don’t think, I know,” was the surprising answer.
“There’s no question about it. In three months you’ll
be as sound and well as you ever were.”</p>

<p class='c012'>The caller was an intelligent man, and the boldness of
the statement, taken in connection with the circumstances
under which it was made—the physician having
had no opportunity to ascertain the exact conditions—was
far from reassuring. It was a bad break on the
doctor’s part, but there was worse to come. The caller
had made up his mind not to trust himself in the hands
of this physician and, as an easy means of escape, asked:</p>

<p class='c012'>“What will the treatment cost, Doctor?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“How much money are you earning? Are you working
for somebody, or are you in business for yourself?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“What has that got to do with it? What difference
does it make to you how much my income is, or where
it comes from?”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>“We’re not treating people for nothing here. We
must know that you are able to pay the fee.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“But you have not told me what the fee is.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“No, and I don’t intend to until I know what your income
is. My rule is to get about one-quarter of a patient’s
income for the time he is under treatment.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Then you have a sort of sliding scale as to fees?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Certainly. If you are earning $50 a week the treatment
will cost you $12.50 a week. If you are earning
$100 a week it will cost you $25 a week.”</p>

<p class='c012'>It is any wonder the caller went away disgusted? And
yet this doctor is unable to understand why he cannot
succeed in special practice. He can see nothing wrong
in his method of handling callers.</p>
<div class='pbb'>
 <hr class='pb c005' />
</div>
<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>
  <h2 id='ch09' class='c007'>CHAPTER IX<br /> <br /><b>DECIDING UPON THE FEE</b></h2>
</div>
<p class='c011'>Having ascertained the financial status of the caller,
and developed the fact that he wants to take the treatment,
the next move is to fix upon an acceptable fee.
Here, again, tact must be used. Ability to pay is not
everything. You must know your man. Take two men
of equal financial rating. To one a fee of $1,000 would
be an extortion; the naming of that amount would give
him a violent attack of heart disease, and yet he could
well afford to pay what was asked. The second man,
with no greater financial resources, would write out his
check for $1,000 without a murmur, and think himself
lucky to get off so cheaply.</p>

<p class='c012'>It’s all a matter of psychological impression. If you
know your man thoroughly, and approach him at the
right moment, you can get any fee that is within his
ability to pay. And this “knowing your man,” rests
largely upon the manner in which you receive him, and
the impression you make upon him. It is a reciprocal
affair. If you get his confidence to the extent that he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>unbosoms himself to you freely, you “know” him; if
you don’t you are going to have hard sleddin’.</p>

<p class='c012'>If the profession is to be judged according to its own
standards the low estimate of the value of medical services
held by the public at large is not to be wondered at.
If the physician does not place the value of his skill and
ability at a high figure, how can he blame the public
for taking advantage of the low rates he names. Surely
the people are not going to volunteer to pay more for an
article than the owner asks for it.</p>

<p class='c012'>A young Western physician, with the right kind of
get-there spirit, settled in New York, where he was called
upon to care for a young woman, the daughter of a multi-millionaire,
who was suffering from typhoid fever. He
saved her life, after a struggle of six months, and sent
in a bill for $5,000, hoping that he might get half of it.
Back came a check for $5,000, with a letter of thanks,
and a “bonus” check for $50,000 more. This may seem
improbable, but it is a fact.</p>

<p class='c012'>This instance is cited for a two-fold purpose: First, to
show that it does not pay to undervalue your services;
and, second, that Eastern people are, as a rule, financial
resources being equal, more accustomed, and more inclined,
to pay liberally than those of the West. In discussing
this incident a Chicago physician, a well-known
man, said:</p>

<p class='c012'>“A Chicago millionaire would have ‘kicked’ on the
$5,000 bill, insisted on its being cut to $2,500, or less, and,
this being done, would have stood suit rather than settle
at his own figure.” In this connection Dr. Lydston
quotes the following case:</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>One of our greatest “merchant princes” was under the
care of a specialist and, as his time was very valuable,
insisted that the doctor let him in at his private door
ahead of all other patients, regardless of the order of
arrival. His bill at $10 a visit amounted to something
over $300. The “kick” registered by our “prince” might
have been heard in Alaska. Result, the bill was cut in
two and the doctor has another enemy on his list.</p>

<p class='c012'>Another merchant prince, who is well known on State
street—we will call him Mr. Bird, because that’s almost
his name, and he is one—came to see me one day in this
wise: He had heard that I had recently operated on a
friend of his and removed a renal calculus. Would I
show him the specimen? He then gradually developed
the interesting fact that he had gall stones and had been
advised to submit to an operation. What did I think of
his case, and what about his operative prospects? Three-quarters
of an hour slipped away, and my opinion in general
had been obtained, when I suggested a physical examination.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, well,” he said, “you see, it has grown so late
that I will not have time to-day. I’ll see you day after
to-morrow,” etc.</p>

<p class='c012'>That same evening, while riding to a case in consultation
with one of my surgeon friends, that gentleman
said, “Oh, by the way, ——, I’m going to operate on
Bird to-morrow for gall stones.” And so it proved. I
sent Mr. Bird a bill for consultation and he replied that he
owed me “nothing,” had “just made a friendly call,” etc.
I finally threatened suit and he paid the bill grudgingly,
and as insolently as he dared at long range. Let me assure
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>the reader that that $25 was a sweeter morsel than
ten times the amount from any other source. Oh, how it
must have hurt my friend Bird! I trust he will be a
mine of wealth to my surgical confrère—he has “gall”
enough to run a stone quarry in his hepatic apparatus for
a hundred years to come.</p>

<p class='c012'>Medical fees have not yet shaken off the incubus put
on them by the dollar fee of the medical “daddies.”
When the country was yet new, the fee question was
practically settled by some of our medical pioneers,
whose influence has never been dispelled. The one-dollar
consultants were over-modest. We have always
been ready to concede that such fees are an undervaluation
of the consultant’s skill. The profession has ever
refused to take some men at their own valuation—but it
has suffered from the incubus just the same. Philanthropy
has been advanced as an explanation of cheap fees.
Quoth the experienced and distinguished low-priced
man, “What would the poor people do if I made myself
less accessible?” They would go around the corner to
that young doctor whose shingle you see swinging to the
breeze, and pay more money for better service than you
or any living man can give for the fees you charge. In
general, the public gets just about what it pays for, save
where the matter is one of absolute charity or dead-beatism.</p>

<p class='c012'>What does a man study law for? In order that he may
be able to practice successfully and make money.</p>

<p class='c012'>What does he study architecture or civil engineering,
or any of the other professions for? Always with the one
purpose of making money out of them.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>No, not always. Medicine is an exception. Judging by
the ordinary standard of fees men study medicine in order
that they may make an unappreciative public a present
of their time and skill—at least most of them do.</p>

<p class='c012'>No fee within the range of the patient’s ability to pay
is ever too great for medical services. The doctor is
never in danger of being overpaid. He should “temper
the wind to the shorn lamb,” but appearances are deceitful,
and the doctor had best be in at the shearing,
else there will be no wool for him. “Virtue is its own
reward” may sound very pretty, but it is not consoling
in view of the fact that it gets no other in this life and its
reward in the world to come is rather problematic.</p>

<p class='c012'>While always seeking to get the largest fee that is
within the patient’s ability and willingness to pay the
clever doctor will never let the patient know but what
the matter of a fee is a secondary consideration. His
earnest talk will be on the prospect of obtaining the desired
results. So far as the patient can judge from the
doctor’s attitude and conversation the professional features
of the case have a much stronger hold upon his
mind than the financial.</p>

<p class='c012'>It is always best, of course, in the matter of fixing
the fee to “strike while the iron is hot.” Do it at the
first consultation, if possible, and have it out of the way.
But the iron is not always hot at this first meeting. Unless
assured that you have won the entire confidence of
the patient, and that you can safely go the limit with
him, don’t attempt to name the fee right away. If you
do it is a certainty that you will get far less than could
readily be had under more favorable circumstances. In
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>a case of this kind, should the patient press to have a
fee named, say:</p>

<p class='c012'>“The fee is a secondary consideration with me, Mr.
——. What I am most interested in is knowing whether
I can benefit you. If I can it will be an easy matter to
agree upon the fee. If I cannot, it would be a waste of
time to take the treatment, and I don’t want your
money.”</p>

<p class='c012'>This is pure “bunk.” The doctor doesn’t mean a word
of it. He is merely sparring for time until he can get the
patient in a more receptive condition, but it makes a ten
strike. Whatever of doubt or hesitancy may have remained
in the patient’s mind is removed.</p>

<p class='c012'>With the powerful remedies now at a doctor’s command
it is a most unusual case in which a decided change
for the better does not follow the first two or three days
of a new treatment. When this stage is reached the
time is ripe for naming the fee.</p>

<p class='c012'>A gentleman suffering from locomotor ataxia came
into the office of a certain physician. He was frank in
his statements. He admitted that he was fairly well
fixed financially and had travelled all over Europe in a
vain effort to find relief. He was willing to take the
treatment as a sort of forlorn hope and wanted the fee
fixed, but the doctor could see that he was still a little
skeptical, and put him off in the manner outlined. On
the third day of treatment the patient said:</p>

<p class='c012'>“Doctor, I want to get this fee matter out of the way.
I know I’m going to get well. For the last two nights
I’ve slept like a baby, something I haven’t done before in
years, and I feel better in every way.”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>This was the doctor’s opportunity and he took advantage
of it, saying:</p>

<p class='c012'>“Well, Mr. ——, since you insist upon knowing the
cost of treatment I’ll name a fee of $1,000 in your case.”</p>

<p class='c012'>The man’s check book was out and a check written
and signed in less than five minutes. It was the proper
psychological moment. As the patient said later:</p>

<p class='c012'>“I was surprised, Doctor, at the moderate fee. If you
had said $5,000 I would have paid it just as quickly as I
did the $1,000.”</p>

<p class='c012'>This man got well. The state of his mind had a great
deal to do with his recovery. The treatment was beneficial,
but he had made up his mind that he was going to
recover, and that was a great factor.</p>

<p class='c012'>Allowing that the psychological moment is reached at
the first meeting, the caller being in a receptive mood
and asking for the terms of treatment, which is often the
case. Don’t be modest. It is easier to lower the terms
than to raise them. If the figure you name is objected
to as being beyond the means of the caller there is always
a way out. Then is the time to say:</p>

<p class='c012'>“The figure I have named, $1,000, is the regular fee,
Mr. ——, but I can readily understand that to pay this
amount might work a hardship in your case. We are not
doing a charity practice. We can’t afford to. And if we
were I am positive you are not the kind of a man who
would take advantage of it. You want to pay for what
you get, provided it is within your means.</p>

<p class='c012'>“In many respects your case is a most peculiar one,
and I would like to undertake it as there is every reason
to look for wonderful results. Now I am going to make
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>you a proposition in strict confidence, and with the distinct
understanding that it remains a secret between the
two of us. I will make the fee $500, and, when you are
restored to health, you are to write me a letter which I
may show privately to other people who are suffering
in the same way. But, under no conditions are you to
tell anybody what fee I charged.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Jump at the proposition? Does a hungry fish take the
bait? He thinks that he is getting something for nothing;
that a special exception has been made in the matter
of a fee because the doctor is confident of restoring him
to health and wants the credit and reputation that would
attach to such a cure.</p>

<p class='c012'>During all this conversation the doctor has cleverly
refrained from alluding to such a thing as a cure in direct
words. In no manner has he committed himself in this
respect, and yet the bait has been so skilfully dangled
that the caller can get no other impression than that a
cure is sure to be obtained.</p>

<p class='c012'>Then there is another class of men who will object to
any fee that may be named in the hope of getting a reduction.
In most instances men of this class are abundantly
able to pay, but are “close.” If gold dollars were
offered to them at 90 cents apiece they would want the
price lowered so as to save something. When a man of
this kind is encountered, and the doctor is bent on getting
the fee he has named, the best thing to do is to make
him ashamed. This may be done without offending
them. One notably successful case taker, famous the
world over for his ability to get large fees, made it a
practice to say:</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>“I agree with you, Mr. ——, that $1,000 seems like a
large fee if we leave the matter of perfect health out of
the question. You surely don’t expect to buy health on
the same basis that you would coal or grain, or some
other merchantable commodity. You are too sensible a
man for that. When you stop to consider that this ailment
is chronic—let’s see, I think you said you had been
afflicted about eight years—and that it is going to take
earnest attention on my part for a long time to restore
you to a normal condition, I think you will agree with me
that, even if we adopt a cold commercial basis of valuation,
the fee is not an extravagant one.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Perhaps you’re right, Doctor, and if I could have any
assurance that—”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Assurance. What can you have beyond what I have
given you? My professional reputation is at stake, and
you have been advised as to what has been accomplished
in other cases. Surely you could have no stronger assurance,
especially that contained in the letters from
patients which I have shown you.”</p>

<p class='c012'>All this is said in a low, well-modulated tone, without
show of special desire to close the case, and it generally
wins. If it does not there is always the alternative of
making a special reduction in this particular case on the
understanding that the terms are confidential, etc. But
it is seldom that this has to be resorted to.</p>

<p class='c012'>When patients go for treatment to a physician of fame,
one whom the newspapers are forever referring to as
“the eminent,” or “the famous Dr. McSwat,” they expect
to pay large fees. If they could get treatment on ordinary
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>terms it would not be so highly esteemed. Fame is
the open sesame to big fee getting.</p>

<p class='c012'>If, after the talk outlined, a caller remains obdurate a
star play may often be made by the physician arising,
pushing his chair back a little, and saying:</p>

<p class='c012'>“I don’t wish to be discourteous, Mr. ——, but I am
compelled to ask you to excuse me. I am a very busy
man, and I am afraid that some of the people who are
waiting to see me will be getting impatient. I am glad
you called, and have really enjoyed my talk with you.
Drop in any time at your convenience. I shall always be
glad to see you.”</p>

<p class='c012'>If the caller has any real intention of taking treatment
this will generally bring him to time. In the first place
it is equivalent to the doctor saying “I am too busy to
waste my time on triflers,” and this touches his pride.
In the second place he is afraid that if he does not take
advantage of the present opportunity something may
arise to change conditions before he can see the doctor
again.</p>

  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER X<br /> <br /><b>GETTING FEES IN ADVANCE</b></h2>
</div>
<p class='c011'>It is one thing for patient and physician to agree upon
a fee. It is another thing for the physician to get the
fee in advance. Still, it can be done in most instances,
but it requires diplomacy of a high order. It is frequently,
one might say almost invariably, the case that,
after the fee has been tacitly agreed upon, the patient
will enquire:</p>

<p class='c012'>“How is this fee to be paid, Doctor?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“In advance,” the doctor will reply in a mild,
it-doesn’t-matter manner.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Isn’t that rather hard on the patient, Doctor?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“It is the only way in which we can protect ourselves.
If we extended credit indiscriminately many patients,
when assured that they were well started on the road to
recovery, would disappear, and it would require long,
expensive litigation to collect from them, even if we
could get service on them here, which is doubtful. The
average man, Mr. ——, has a queer idea about the obligation
of a doctor’s bill. It is the last thing he will pay
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>voluntarily, even when almost miraculous benefits have
been obtained.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Don’t you ever extend credit?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, yes. When assured of a man’s financial responsibility
and honest intention, we are glad to accommodate
him in a reasonable way if it is inconvenient for him to
pay cash.”</p>

<p class='c012'>In this, as in naming the fee, the physician must create
the impression in the mind of the subject that payment
of the fee is about the last thing he is thinking of. There
must be no anxiety, no undue haste to get the money—at
least not so that the patient can notice it. Switching the
conversation for a few moments back to the case itself,
in order to get the patient’s mind diverted, the doctor
will finally say:</p>

<p class='c012'>“Now, in your case, Mr. ——, if it is any object to you,
I can arrange for you to pay the fee monthly. If this is
satisfactory you can pay $150 a month while you are
under treatment.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“How long will that be, Doctor?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I don’t know. Certainly six months, perhaps twelve,
and possibly longer. Nobody can tell in advance how
a chronic ailment like yours will respond to treatment.
It is very seldom that we have two cases exactly alike in
this respect. If there is such a thing as striking an average
I would place it at about ten months.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Would I have to remain here all that time?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, no. A month or so, should be sufficient. May be
less. Just long enough to allow me to get the treatment
graduated to meet the requirements of your case. Then
you may return home and continue it there. It would be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>better, of course, if you could stay here the entire time,
but there is no real necessity for it.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“On the basis of ten months it would cost me $1,500?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“About that. Perhaps a little less; perhaps a little
more. By taking advantage of the $1,000 proposition
you will save about $500. It is really immaterial to me
which offer you accept save for one thing. No matter
how well a patient is progressing there is sure to be more
or less reaction at times. It would be marvellous if there
were not. These spells of reaction are only temporary,
but the patient, not understanding this, is inclined to become
discouraged and, if he is paying his fee by the
month, may quit just at the time when, if he had continued
treatment a little longer, he would have become
a well man. In such a case he not only loses the money
he has paid, but also the certainty of recovering his
health. On the other hand, if his fee is paid, he will
argue that he might as well stick it out as it isn’t going
to cost him any more.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Naturally I want to obtain as great an amount of success
professionally as possible. For this reason when a
patient asks my advice on the subject I tell him to pay
the fee and get it off his mind. This not only saves him
money, but relieves him of financial worry so that he
responds more readily to treatment and, above all, it
makes sure of his continuing the treatment until his
health is restored.”</p>

<p class='c012'>While endeavoring to convince the patient that the
fee occupies a minor place in your mind, do so by actions
and manner, not by words. Never say outright that you
don’t care when the fee is paid, or that you are not thinking
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>about the fee, or anything of that kind. If the patient
sees fit to form this impression, let him do so; it strengthens
the probability of your getting the money. The
average man, especially the one who has money, is not
a fool. He is quick to form conclusions. If he can see
where he can save $500 on a bill of $1,500 he is going to
grasp the opportunity without much urging, provided
he is reasonably well assured of getting value received.
This assurance is entirely a matter of confidence. If the
doctor has obtained the patient’s confidence by dignified,
yet courteous (not servile) manner, and modest talk, he
is going to get the fee then and there. If he has fallen
short of securing this confidence all the arguments he
can advance will not induce the patient to unbelt. In
fact, the more argument he makes the weaker his case
becomes.</p>

<p class='c012'>A discount of one-third is a proposition which appeals
to any man of business sense. He does not know, of
course, that the physician has named a figure much
higher than he is willing to accept, with this very purpose
in view. One thousand dollars would be a lucrative
fee if paid by the month, and the doctor can well afford
to accept it in advance on the terms he names. Few
people will take treatment longer than three, or at the
most four, months. They either become well in that
time, or grow discouraged and quit.</p>

<p class='c012'>Another thing. There is a great deal of convincing
force in the statement that payment of the fee in advance
holds the patient to the treatment. At least it
looks that way to the layman.</p>

<p class='c012'>In most instances where a man has the funds in bank
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>he will write a check without further comment. Occasionally
a patient will be unable to do this, owing to a
shortage of funds, and will say:</p>

<p class='c012'>“Well, I have decided to take the treatment, Doctor,
if you can give me a little time on part of the fee. I can
pay you $500 now, but would like about sixty days’ time
on the rest.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Certainly, Mr. ——. If it will be an accommodation
to you I will be glad to do it. It is contrary to our usual
practice, but I feel that I am safe in making an exception
in your case.”</p>

<p class='c012'>The check is written and handed to the doctor who,
without apparently examining it, puts it carelessly in his
pocket, and then makes an entry in his desk diary, noting
the patient’s name and address, nature of his ailment,
date, amount of fee, and size of payment. When all this
is done the first treatment is given, and engagement
made for succeeding treatments at a certain hour each
day.</p>

<p class='c012'>Taking advantage of the time when the patient is rearranging
his clothes after treatment the doctor hurriedly
fills out a sixty day note for $500, making it payable
to the order of the patient himself. Just as the
latter is ready to leave the doctor will say:</p>

<p class='c012'>“There’s just one thing more, Mr. ——. In order to
guard against any possible misunderstanding in the
future I have drawn up a little memorandum of our
agreement as a sort of protection to you. Now, if you
will kindly place your signature there——”</p>

<p class='c012'>As he says this the doctor rises from his chair and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>motions the patient into it, at the same time dipping a
pen in the ink well and handing it to him.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, on that line; yes, that’s the place. Now (turning
the note over so the back is uppermost), once more
across the end, so. There, now we have the agreement
in form so no one can take advantage of you. Be sure
to come promptly at 10:30 to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='c012'>After the first treatment most men are excited and
easy to handle in this way. They do what the doctor
bids in a sort of unconscious way. They don’t realize
that they are signing a note. The doctor has referred to
it as a memorandum of agreement, and it seems only
proper that there should be a writing of this nature.</p>

<p class='c012'>Sharp practice? Yes. Dishonest? No. The patient
has agreed to pay a fee of $1,000. He has paid $500 down
and promised to pay the rest in sixty days. The doctor
has merely induced him to put this promise on paper.
If the maker of the note is responsible (and the doctor
has assured himself of this in advance) the full $1,000 is
secured then and there, less an ordinary discount fee on
$500, as a note of this kind is easily negotiable. The
doctor has taken the precaution to protect himself instead
of depending entirely upon the honesty and good
intention of his patient.</p>

<p class='c012'>The latter has barely left the office before both check
and note, properly endorsed, are on the way to the bank
where the note is discounted and the proceeds, with the
check, deposited to the credit of the physician.</p>

<p class='c012'>It may be said that this sounds too easy and simple to
be true. Perhaps it does to those who are not acquainted
with the methods of the up-to-date “case
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>taker.” But fees, and big fees, are being obtained in exactly
this manner every day in every large city in the
country.</p>

<p class='c012'>The physician who has a well-established office practice
does not, as a rule, resort to this method with his
regular patrons at first. He charges what seems to be a
large fee, $5 to $10 each time a patient calls, extends
credit indiscriminately, and loses fully one-half of the
money represented by his book charges. If he is wise he
learns by experience, and caters to the patronage of
strangers from whom he can get his fees in advance.
He gradually gets too busy to receive those who want
their fees charged. He has learned his lesson and is willing
to profit by the example set by other doctors who,
while not recognized as models in the line of ethics,
know how to make the practice of medicine pay.</p>

<p class='c012'>“How’s business, Doc?” asked a friend of a physician
who has achieved considerable fame as an office specialist.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Bully,” was the reply. “Did over $300 to-day.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Get it?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“No, but it’s good.”</p>

<p class='c012'>And the poor fool actually thought so until he failed
to get any adequate returns from the many bills he sent
out, or the numerous calls made by his hired collector.
Now he is making money. Why? Because every caller,
whether regular patient or stranger, who wants to consult
that doctor professionally, must “ante” his $10 with
the polite secretary in the reception room before he can
get into the doctor’s office. Result, exodus of dead beats,
and others whom there was no profit in seeing.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>Prominent attorneys adopt this system. Why is it not
just as ethical and fair for physicians to employ it? If
a patient agrees to pay the fee asked by the physician
there is no reason, moral or legal, why he should not do
so. And yet, unless this fee is paid in advance, or well
secured, the chances are about ten to one that the doctor
will never get it.</p>

<p class='c012'>Sometimes the patient will discover that the “memorandum”
he is signing is a note, and may say:</p>

<p class='c012'>“Why this is a note, Doctor?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Well, it is in note form, but you will see that it is
payable to your own order, Mr. ——,” the doctor will
say. “I don’t think it will be of much use to anybody
else. It is put in this form for your own protection.”</p>

<p class='c012'>This is usually sufficient, unless the patient is a city
banker, or an unusually smart man of business. Should
this latter be the case, which is not likely as men of this
class invariably pay cash in advance, an explanation is
readily forthcoming to the effect that it is merely an
evidence of good faith on the maker’s part, etc. Occasions
of this kind are very rare, however, as most men
are so thoroughly hypnotized at the moment that they
readily do whatever the doctor suggests.</p>

<p class='c012'>The smart man is as a rule the easiest to get a good
fee from. His business education has been such that he
is not looking for something for nothing. If a thing is
really good he knows it must be paid for, and that the
price must be in accordance with its merits—or supposed
merits. Strong belief in actual merit is a matter of education,
the doctor acting as instructor and demonstrator.</p>

<p class='c012'>One holiday when the office was closed the writer and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>the physician with whom he was associated in business
were sitting in the doctor’s private room discussing ways
and means for getting in more patients. The main entrance
door was locked. Suddenly the knob was heard
to turn and it was evident somebody was trying to get
in. Going to the door the writer opened it and stood
face to face with one of the best known and wealthiest
men in Chicago, a man noted for being extremely close
in his financial deals. Affecting not to know him the
writer said:</p>

<p class='c012'>“What can I do for you, sir?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I’d like to see Dr. ——.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“The office is not open for the reception of patients
to-day, but the doctor happens to be here for a moment.
If you will step in and take a seat I will ascertain if he
can see you.”</p>

<p class='c012'>When the caller was seated the doctor was hurriedly
notified as to his identity and financial means, and word
was sent out to show the gentleman in. After a consultation
of twenty minutes the caller left, and the doctor
had his check for $2,500. As he handed it to the writer
the doctor said:</p>

<p class='c012'>“Mr. —— did not have one of his own checks with
him, and had to write this on one of our blank forms.
He doesn’t want it to go through his bank in this shape
and has asked me to hold it until he comes in Saturday
when he will exchange it for one of his own.”</p>

<p class='c012'>The check was put away and on Saturday when Mr.
—— called the writer, who was the treasurer of the concern,
was out at luncheon. As the new patient handed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>the second check to the doctor the latter was compelled
to say:</p>

<p class='c012'>“I’m sorry, Mr. ——, but I’m unable to give you back
your first check right away, Mr. ——, our treasurer, has
it locked up in the safe, and I cannot get it until he returns
from luncheon.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, that’s all right,” replied Mr. ——. “Any time
will do.”</p>

<p class='c012'>And away he went, leaving both checks, representing
$5,000, and as good as gold, in our possession. The
doctor had won his confidence from the start.</p>

<p class='c012'>In this particular instance there had been no advance
correspondence, and the caller was unknown to the
doctor either personally or by name. The writer happened
to know him by sight and thus was able to “tip”
him off to the doctor. If it had not been for this it is
probable that the fee would not have been more than
$500, and the doctor would have congratulated himself
on having done a good day’s work at that. What makes
the case even more remarkable is the fact, as previously
stated, that the man had the reputation of being very
close in money matters. Yet here was an instance in
which he not only paid the fee of $2,500 in advance without
a murmur, but actually entrusted a stranger with
$5,000 of his funds.</p>

<p class='c012'>After two weeks of personal treatment this same man,
acting on the advice of the doctor (who was to share in
the fee) had partially arranged to pay another specialist
$10,000 for the treatment of his wife, and was on the
point of closing the contract when the blundering tactics
of the second physician upset the whole thing. Negotiations
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>were progressing favorably, there was no dispute
as to the amount of the fee, or anything of that kind,
when a single mis-step aroused his suspicions, and the
deal fell through. In talking the matter over later Mr.
—— said:</p>

<p class='c012'>“I may be sorry, Doctor, that I did not accept Doctor
——’s proposition, but to tell the truth he didn’t impress
me favorably. Now if it were you who were to conduct
the treatment I wouldn’t hesitate a moment.”</p>

<p class='c012'>The joke of the thing—and it was a joke—lay in the
fact that of the two men the doctor he had no confidence
in was by far the more able and competent of the two.
But he lacked tact; he didn’t know how to inspire confidence
in his patients; didn’t know how to conceal the
disagreeable truth and enlarge on the non-essentials
making them appear as the more important of the two.
He was too brutally frank. The doctor who got the
$2,500 fee and retained the entire confidence of his
patient to the last, was a past master in the gentle art of
what is known in slang parlance as “bull con.”</p>

<p class='c012'>All of which tends to show that the getting of a big
cash fee rests entirely on the impression created by the
physician. If this impression is favorable the fee will be
forthcoming; if it is not a yoke of oxen couldn’t yank it
away from the patient.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>
  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER XI<br /> <br /><b>GETTING ADDITIONAL FEES</b></h2>
</div>
<p class='c011'>It is a well-understood fact among physicians that the
average man of 50 or over takes more interest and pride
in his sexual virility than in any other phase of his
physical system. It is equally well known that in almost
every instance where a man has reached the age of 50
there is a very perceptible flagging or falling off in sexual
power. In many instances it is entirely lost when
the half-century mark is reached, or soon afterward.
There are few men who care to admit this even to their
family physicians, and, in consequence of this shyness,
they fall ready victims to quacks of the “Be A Man”
stripe.</p>

<p class='c012'>When a man well past middle age comes into your
office never broach the subject of sexual trouble to him
at first, no matter how strongly you suspect it. If you
do he will take treatment for that first, and that is the
end of it. Secure him on some other line of treatment
first. Humor his ideas in this respect—he has whatever
ailment he may fancy he has. If you are satisfied
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>that he is in position to pay well, but is hard to deal with
in a financial way, it will pay you to name a modest fee
for the initial treatment, but don’t let him get away. He
will afford fat, liberal picking later on.</p>

<p class='c012'>Where men of ordinary means will haggle over a $250
fee for being successfully treated for some annoying,
really dangerous ailment, they will pay $1,000 or more
cheerfully on anything that seems like a reasonable assurance
of having their sexual power restored to its
pristine vigor. There is not a physician in the land
with any considerable practice who doesn’t know this.</p>

<p class='c012'>Having secured your fee from a patient of this kind
for the regular treatment of the trouble concerning
which he came to consult you, and at the time when the
treatment is beginning to show favorable results, spring
the trap. As before stated there is generally a time when
nearly every patient responds to greater or less extent to
a new treatment. This response may be only temporary;
it generally is. When the indications of this
response are seen then is the time to act. It is the proper
psychological moment.</p>

<p class='c012'>Direct the conversation to the marked improvement in
his condition, tell how much you are encouraged by the
very noticeable change, and suggest another thorough
physical examination so that you may make the proper
record of his case. When the patient has disrobed give
him the same thorough, searching examination you did
when he first came to the office. Pay no attention to the
sexual organs at first, but, when nearing the end of the
examination say casually:</p>

<p class='c012'>“How long have you been in that condition, Mr. ——?”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>This is a random shot, but it will strike home ninety-nine
times out of a hundred. There is very little chance
of its going astray. Almost invariably the patient will
ask:</p>

<p class='c012'>“What condition do you refer to, Doctor?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Why your sexual organs are not exactly normal, are
they?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Well, to tell the truth, Doctor, I am not as strong as
I was a few years ago, but suppose it’s the natural result
of advancing years.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“You’re not an old man yet, Mr. ——. You are only
55, I think you told me. You ought to be good for at
least ten years yet, and perhaps longer.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Do you really think so, Doctor. Is there any hope in
that direction?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Most certainly. There is little question about the
result. Modern science has given us an entirely new
method of treatment in cases of this kind the effects of
which are little short of miraculous. The one trouble,
however, is that it is expensive, so much so that I hesitate
to speak of it as a rule.”</p>

<p class='c012'>No power on earth can prevent that man from having
that treatment regardless of the expense. He has by
this time an enlarged idea as to the doctor’s ability. He
is pleased with the results of the treatment administered
for the original ailment. He is impressed by the evident
professional skill of the doctor in “discovering” a sexual
condition which he fancied was known only to himself.
He does not know that the physician has simply made a
shrewd guess; one that he is in the habit of making several
times a week, and generally with the same result.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>He is in the seventh heaven of delight. The doctor has
adroitly dangled before his eyes a certainty which he
had been vainly praying for. His next question is:</p>

<p class='c012'>“What will it cost?”</p>

<p class='c012'>Direct answer to this depends upon what the doctor
has learned about the patient’s financial rating and willingness
to pay. Few cases of this kind are taken under
$1,000. Allowing that the physician has decided upon
this amount as the extreme limit, he will reply:</p>

<p class='c012'>“It is hard to say exactly, Mr. ——. Somewhere between
$1,000 and $1,500. It depends upon what I have
to expend for the remedies and permission to use them.
They come from abroad and can only be obtained with
the consent of the scientist who introduced them. That
kind of men, as you doubtless know, are not always easy
to deal with.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Well, the price is pretty steep, but if you are satisfied
the treatment will do the work I want it.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“There’s no doubt about the merits of the treatment,
Mr. ——. The only thing, as I said before, that holds
me back from recommending it generally, is its high
cost. Besides I don’t, as a usual thing, care to handle
cases of that nature.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Smart doctor! He has got his human fly stuck on a
gummed trap from which he couldn’t extricate himself
if he would, and he doesn’t want to. If this wonderful
treatment will restore his lost sexual power, and the
doctor, in whom he has strong confidence, has told him
it would, he’s going to have it. There is a little more
conversation of an innocuous sort, and then the doctor
says:</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>“I’ll tell you what I will do, Mr. ——. While I am
not certain that the cost of the treatment may not run as
high as $1,500, you may pay me $1,000 and I will endeavor
to get the case closed for that amount. Should
it be necessary to pay the other $500 I’ll leave it to your
honor, but I am reasonably confident that I can make
the necessary arrangements for $1,000.”</p>

<p class='c012'>This looks good to the man who has rosy visions of a
restoration to the fire and vigor of youth, and he generally
draws a check on the spot. If his bank account
will not admit of this he gives a “memorandum,” at least
that is what the doctor calls it, and the deal is closed.</p>

<p class='c012'>There are similar ways of getting additional fees from
patients who have already paid well for the original
treatment. One man (or woman) needs the eyes looked
after and fitted with proper glasses, another should have
the teeth fixed up, another requires a special surgical
appliance, while still another should have a special prescription
compounded.</p>

<p class='c012'>The doctor always has a list of experts to whom he
directs patients on the fee-sharing plan, and these fees
are never over-modest. To the doctor’s credit be it said
that he invariably warns such patients that if they want
the best they must expect to pay well for it. It will undoubtedly
cost considerable money, but the results will
justify the expenditure.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Your eyes certainly need attention, Mrs. ——, and it
would be a good plan to have it done while you are here
in Chicago. The longer you put it off, the more serious
the complication will become. But, whatever you do,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>don’t go to one of these cheap occulist fakirs. They are
liable to ruin your eyesight.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Who is a good man, Doctor?” is the natural inquiry.</p>

<p class='c012'>“There are a number of able, competent oculists here.
Dr. Seestraight stands at the head of his profession, and
is probably the most satisfactory of the lot. I’ll give you
a card to him, if you wish. He has always attended to
my eyes, and has given satisfaction.”</p>

<p class='c012'>This proffer is gladly accepted and when the patient
leaves the doctor’s office she carries a note of introduction
to Dr. Seestraight. It is an innocent looking note,
but it contains a hidden cipher which gives the oculist
a tip as to the fee which he may safely name. This
cipher is generally made in flourishes, under the doctor’s
signature, unintelligible to the patient, mere flourishes
as it were, but perfectly plain to Dr. Seestraight. When
the latter collects his fee he sends half of it to the physician
who recommended the patient, and the incident
is closed.</p>

<p class='c012'>The same arrangements are made with certain pharmacists,
dentists, and surgical instrument makers. There
was one physician in Chicago who made it a practice to
say to certain of his patients:</p>

<p class='c012'>“You are getting along very nicely, but recovery
would be much more rapid if you could take a little extra
special treatment. But I hesitate to suggest it on account
of the expense and the difficulty of procuring the
proper ingredients.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Darn the expense, Doctor, if the stuff will do me
good. What is it, and where can I get it.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“There are several ingredients, and the only place in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>Chicago where there is any prospect of finding them is
at Doem &amp; Doem’s. But they don’t always have a supply.
They are foreign preparations, very expensive, and
there is such little demand for them that pharmacists
dislike to carry them in stock. I’ll write the prescription,
but I can’t vouch for your getting it compounded.
At any rate if you can’t get it filled at Doem &amp; Doem’s,
there’s no use trying any other drug store.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“You dwell so on the expense, Doctor, that I’m curious.
What will it cost?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“The expense varies somewhat. The last patient I
supplied with the prescription had to pay $23.25.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“That’s nothing.”</p>

<p class='c012'>The prescription is written and Doem &amp; Doem find on
it a cipher telling them that the patient will stand for
$25. As a member of the firm glances it over he says to
the customer:</p>

<p class='c012'>“This is a very rare and expensive preparation. It
happens that we have just about enough material on
hand to fill it, but I feel that I should warn you first that
it will be very expensive.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I expected that. Dr. —— told me that it would probably
cost $23 or $24.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“That would have been a fair price a few weeks ago,
but since then there has been an advance in the cost of
the materials and I shall have to charge you $25.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“All right. Go ahead and fill it. A dollar or so won’t
stop me.”</p>

<p class='c012'>The customer gets an ordinary preparation which any
druggist would be glad to sell at 50 or 60 cents, while
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>Messrs. Doem &amp; Doem pocket $12.50, and send a like
amount to the enterprising doctor.</p>

<p class='c012'>Nor is this practice confined to what might be called
the tradesmen in medicine, the druggists, the surgical
instrument dealers, and so on. It is followed by what
are known as high-class surgeons, men of eminence in
the profession, and even finds favor among the physicians
themselves. It is no uncommon thing for the
doctors to exchange patients and divide the fees.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Really, Mr. ——, you ought to consult Dr. Flubdub
about that feature of your case,” a doctor will say to a
patient when he has about exhausted him on the fee
proposition. “That particular feature is a little out of
my line. It needs the attention of an expert specialist
in that line, and Dr. Flubdub has made a close study of
just such cases.”</p>

<p class='c012'>So the patient goes to see Dr. Flubdub and the latter
is ready for him. He has been advised by phone as to
what is coming about as follows:</p>

<p class='c012'>“Hello, is this Dr. Flubdub? Yes. This is Dr. Grab.
I have just advised a patient—Mr. ——, to see you. He
seems to have a little ear trouble that needs attention.
He’ll stand for about $250.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Thanks to the tip given by Dr. Grab the ear specialist
is able to speedily locate and describe the trouble with
which Mr. —— is afflicted. Dr. Flubdub names his fee
at $250, collects it, and sends $125 to his worthy brother,
Dr. Grab. It’s a case of two pluck one.</p>

<p class='c012'>When opportunity offers Dr. Flubdub returns the
favor by sending patients to Dr. Grab who, in turn
divides the fee, and thus the medical mill is kept busy.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>Some physicians are very bold in demanding a division
of fees as if it were right, rather than a honorarium.
There is a letter in a certain office in Chicago, preserved
as an evidence of gall, in which the writer says, when
suggesting that he can send the recipient a patient:</p>

<p class='c012'>“The woman will do just about what I tell her. She
is business-like, and so am I. I think she will stand for
$200. Now, if you can see any money in that after giving
me $100, I’ll send her to you; if not, why I know
plenty of others who will take the case on those terms.
She is my meat, and will go where I say. I am not
charging $100 for my time, but for steering the case to
you. This is my game and I can steer the case where I
please,” etc.</p>

<p class='c012'>Nothing modest or backward, no hesitancy about this.
The writer comes bluntly to the point, without false
delicacy or reserve. Well, to give the devil his due, the
fellow was honest in his straightforwardness. He knew
what he wanted, and didn’t hesitate to ask for it. And
the doctor who received the letter? Well, to tell the
truth, he had conscientious scruples against that sort of
thing, so he lost the case. Another physician of equal
prominence got the patient, presumably on the terms
named by the writer of the letter.</p>

<p class='c012'>Speaking of deals between physicians and undertakers,
Dr. G. Frank Lydston says:</p>

<p class='c012'>“Over on the great West Side lives an undertaker
friend of mine, who, in deference to his ancient and honorable
vocation, we will call Mr. Watery Weeps. My
friend Weeps has an eye to business; in faith, he has
two eyes to business—both of ‘em red; some say from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>‘red eye’ homeopathically applied. I do not believe this
theory regarding Mr. Weeps’ headlights. Their peculiar
bicycle lamp glow, like their excessive humidity, is due
to his faithful, sorrowful ‘proxifying.’ In the course of
my practice it did befall that a certain pulmonopathic
vassal of mine—we will designate him as Mr. One-Lung,
insomuch as he had no other lung—did feloniously, with
malice prepense and aforethought and intent to deceive,
up and die. Having a corpse on my hands, I naturally
bethought me of my post-medical friend, Weeps, who
undertaketh much in that vicinity. Weeps was prompt,
and my late friend of the pulmonary solitaire was soon
duly boxed and crated, ready for shipment to his ancestral
home in ‘Injianny,’ whereupon quoth Weeps,
lachrymosing his prettiest the while:</p>

<p class='c012'>“‘Ahem, Doctor, I am very much obliged to you for
the favor you have shown me. I hope to do a large
share of your business in the future. I expect a check
for this job to-morrow, and will then extend to you the
<i>usual courtesies</i> to the medical profession.’</p>

<p class='c012'>“‘Ah,’ I replied, ‘and what might that be?’</p>

<p class='c012'>“‘Why, 25 per cent. I call that pretty good, too, considering
the hard times, don’t you Doctor?’</p>

<p class='c012'>“And my friend Weeps still thinks I was bluffing
when I declined the ‘usual courtesies.’ Truth is strange,
passing strange—stranger than fiction.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Then there is another class of physicians who will
not hesitate to take advantage of a brother practitioner
if they can do so to their own benefit. This is done in
several ways: One method is to misrepresent the financial
status of the patient whom he takes to an expert for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>consultation. It is not long since a physician called up
another by telephone and arranged for him to see a
“poor patient” who could only pay a small fee for consultation.
The doctor thus called upon discovered that
the patient, who was a wealthy stock raiser from the
West, had paid his doctor friend a good fee already, and
had arranged to pay him $200 more for the prospective
operation—which the second doctor was expected to tell
his friend how to do.</p>

<p class='c012'>It is frequently the case that general practitioners
call a consultant without making arrangements for the
fee beforehand. It is unpleasant to spend half a day or
night in consultation and then have the doctor say:</p>

<p class='c012'>“Now, doctor, these people haven’t got much money,
so don’t charge them a large fee.”</p>

<p class='c012'>The consultant thereupon cuts his fee in two.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Well, doctor, I’ll see that you get it in a day or two,”
is the reply. But the consultant never gets it. Should
he protest, the family physician says, “Don’t be in such
a hurry, doctor, I haven’t got anything out of the case
myself, yet.”</p>

<p class='c012'>How easy it would be for the physician who calls the
consultation to see that the fee is ready when the consultant
comes. Unless there is an understanding that
the case is one of pure charity, the physician calling the
consultation should be held responsible for the fee.
The consultant himself cannot always do so, but where
possible he should stipulate beforehand that a certain
fee be in readiness. The family physician who does not
know that such a plan is best for his own interests is
stupid.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>An intolerable nuisance to the consultant is the doctor
who writes a friendly letter asking for “the diagnosis,
prognosis and treatment” of some case under his care.
Rarely does he inclose a stamp, never a fee. The consultant
who answers such letters, save to inform the
writer that office rent cannot be paid by such consultations,
is frequently laughed at for his pains, but this
should be the rule.</p>

<p class='c012'>A more “pestiferous professional parasite,” if possible,
than the foregoing, is the doctor who refers a patient
from a distance, with a request to send the bill to him.
Here again Dr. Lydston says: “I have sent many such
bills first and last—accent on the ‘last’—but have never
received a remittance, nor do I expect my reward in
Heaven. In the first place, I am not so sure about
getting there, and if I were, and knew that those doctor
debtors were going to be there too, I—well, I’d ask
for a change of venue. As for the patients who are accessories
to such professional ‘hold-ups,’ a fellow
wouldn’t want to chase around all over hades to collect
his fees from them.”</p>

<p class='c012'>No less an authority than Dr. John P. Lord, president
of the Western Surgical Association, in an address delivered
before the association, said:</p>

<p class='c012'>“The practitioner,” he said, “will call a man of sufficient
standing to enable him to name a fancy price as
the consultant’s fee, which he collects, and then remits
the consultant the minimum fee. The graft element
is also going into medical politics and some county societies
are controlled by it.”</p>

<p class='c012'>It will be noticed that Dr. Lord does not find fault
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>so much with the division of fees, as with the unfair
manner of division. His plaint appears to be, not that
division in itself is wrong, but that the man who handles
the money does not treat his professional brother fairly.
There’s a lot of truth in this, but the objectionable practice
is mostly confined to a class of short-sighted practitioners
who don’t take the future into consideration.</p>

<p class='c012'>Another doctor, speaking on the same subject, said:
“This is an age of commercialism in medicine and surgery.
Graft rules the majority. There are a few old
fogies, like myself, who don’t graft—but do you know
why? Just because we’re too old to learn how. Oh,
yes, we’d all do it if we had a chance, I presume. We’d
be forced to. Those who do it claim that they have
to. It may be the public’s fault, but it’s certainly hard
on the public which has to do the paying and which
doesn’t know whether it has stomach ache or appendicitis.</p>

<p class='c012'>“In ancient Rome the doctors used to graft successfully.
They’d place a finger on the severed end of an
artery and say to the patient: ‘Now, old fellow, just
come across with the fee, right away, or the finger will
be removed and you’ll bleed to death.’</p>

<p class='c012'>“We are coming to that. We may not work it in the
same way, but the idea will be the same. Even now
they—or we—want money before operations, and will
endeavor to learn something of a patient’s standing in
the community before his check will be accepted.
Wouldn’t a business man do the same thing? And if
surgery is becoming a business, why isn’t it proper?
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>It is proper—from that standpoint. But, oh, the pity of
the passing of old ideals!</p>

<p class='c012'>“The whole matter seems to me a question of economics.
The medical profession is a belated profession.
We cannot collect a fee by statute under certain conditions—as
when the call comes from a third party.
We must have money. What is there left to do? Graft!
Or ‘commercialize.’ That’s a nicer name for it. Let’s
see now just what the public brings on its own head.</p>

<p class='c012'>“There’s a man who thinks it is necessary that his
leg comes off. He has nerved himself for the operation
and has announced his willingness to pay, say $250. A
conscientious surgeon examines the leg and saves it
without the use of a knife and the man recovers the use
of it. In a few days he is able to sit up and dispute the
bill for $100, claiming it is exorbitant. What do you
think his argument is? This:</p>

<p class='c012'>“‘You didn’t have to operate. Why should it cost
so much?’”</p>

<p class='c012'>“That may not be logic, but it’s what happens right
along. That is the grateful reply we get from many
patients for saving them from mutilation. And it is
things like that which have largely influenced surgeons,
I believe, to operate when it is unnecessary. It is not
right, of course. A surgeon should be as a father and
mother to a helpless, sick soul. Still he is human and
he must live. Like Robin Hood, there is a better class
of surgical robber who takes only from the rich.</p>

<p class='c012'>“You know, the rich are always in a precarious condition.
It’s a mighty conscientious doctor who will tell
a rich man that his trouble is only imaginary. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>average physician or surgeon will fly around briskly,
‘dope’ the man up and then probably remove a perfectly
good appendix—bill $2,000.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I attended the son of a rich man who really had appendicitis
at one time. The operation was successful
and the boy pulled through, although I never saw a more
serious case. I sent in a bill for $2,000 and received no
reply. I tried again and received no reply. Shortly
afterward I met this man on the street—you’d know his
name if I were to mention it—and he said, ‘I have no
intention of paying your exorbitant bill.’</p>

<p class='c012'>“I wouldn’t sue. Never do. Bad practice. So I
compromised for $500, although he could have paid $10,000
without missing it—and the operation was worth it.</p>

<p class='c012'>“There are rogues in every profession. There are
brutes in the medical profession who will demand money
from a woman before she is out of the anæsthetic—who
will haggle with a dying man as to terms. And there
are many of them. I could mention names of men in
Chicago that would make you open your eyes. The
really first-class doctor of the old school who retains the
old ideas of the profession should have a halo. He deserves
it. Of course he can’t live by pursuing such antiquated
methods as those of a gentleman, but then—says
the rest of the world—who needs to live, anyway?”</p>

<p class='c012'>The surgeon was asked about the number of cases
where lives had been lost through carelessness or stupidity
on the part of surgeons.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Caveat emptor!” was his reply. “You know the old
gag? Let the purchaser beware. He doesn’t have to
go to a poor doctor. Even some of the biggest grafters
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>are eminent surgeons and at the top of their profession.
I do not underestimate their ability. But heaven only
knows there are ever so many cases of recklessness or
carelessness or foolishness which have taken lives. Patients
keep right on dying, you know, in spite of doctors
or because of them.</p>

<p class='c012'>“A good example of graft which came to my notice is
this: A young Swedish farmer called in a doctor in a
small town. He had pains and other things and looked
generally shot to pieces. The young doctor speedily
discovered that the real trouble was lack of air—unsanitary
conditions in the home.</p>

<p class='c012'>“‘You haven’t typhoid fever, you goat,’ he told the
fellow. ‘I’ll fix you in a few days.’</p>

<p class='c012'>“He opened the bedroom window first. Some one had
told the farmer he ought not to raise his window nights,
and there he was sleeping in that foul atmosphere. No
wonder he felt badly. Well, anyway, in the course of a
few days my friend had him feeling better. One day he
called up and said he ‘wouldn’t be around that day. It
wouldn’t be necessary—patient better,’ and so forth.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Then the quack hove in sight. Some one had heard
of him and he was sent for. He gave the convalescent
Swede one look and said: ‘My God, man! You’ve got
typhoid! Back into bed with you immediately or you’ll
die.’ The terrified farmer crawled back into bed and
began to feel worse immediately. Then the quack
‘doped’ him religiously for a few days and ‘completely
cured him.’ My friend had been let go in the meantime.</p>

<p class='c012'>“The idea of the younger generation of doctors, I find,
is just opposed to the old ideal. The young man wants
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>money and as a rule he isn’t particular how he gets it.
He hustles through school, gorges his mind for the ‘quiz’—a
ridiculous thing—and gets his diploma. No really
good man could pass a ‘quiz.’</p>

<p class='c012'>“Some schools, of course, are good, and I will say that
the material we have in this country of which to make
doctors cannot be improved on; but, on the other hand,
some of the schools—many of them—are so bad that no
school at all would be better.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I must say that I do not entirely agree with everything
you have said in your book, but I must confess
there is much truth in your statements. As for Dr.
Lord’s contentions—anent grafting, fee splitting and
that sort of thing—well, almost everybody’s doing it. I
know that. The number of physicians and surgeons in
Chicago who would not do it is so small that it would
be like looking for a needle in a haystack to find them.”</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>
  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER XII<br /> <br /><b>PROPER HANDLING OF NOTES</b></h2>
</div>
<p class='c011'>There are times when as explained in Chapter X, the
full fee cannot be obtained in cash on the spot. When
this occurs the only way out of the difficulty is to get
the patient to sign a note. But never, when it can be
avoided, allow the note to be made payable to yourself.
Draw it to the order of the patient and have him endorse
it. Also make it payable at a bank, the name of which
is specified. This makes it negotiable and, if the financial
standing of the maker is satisfactory, it will be
readily discounted wherever he is known.</p>

<p class='c012'>It is comparatively easy for the maker of a note payable
to the order of a second party to evade payment,
or at least greatly delay it, on the plea of “no value received.”
It becomes doubly so in cases where the note
is drawn in favor of a physician, or the maker lives in
another state. When this occurs, and it cannot be
shown that the paper has passed into the possession of
an innocent holder for a bona fide consideration in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>ordinary course of business, there will be trouble in collecting
on it should the maker repudiate the obligation.</p>

<p class='c012'>In such event collection, if made at all, must be enforced
through the medium of a law suit. This necessitates
service on the maker. If he can be found within
the limits of the state in which the note was signed he
can be sued there, but, as a general thing, this is a forlorn
hope. As a general thing it necessitates a court
action in the state where the maker resides, and this
means a hearing before a jury of his own neighbors. In
such cases a non-resident claimant has small chance of
winning, no matter how just his claim may be. And
this chance is still further reduced if he is a physician.
Residents of other states do not look with favor upon
non-resident doctors. Not only this, but as a general
thing they think it their duty to assist a neighbor in
evading payment of an obligation to a doctor who is not
one of them.</p>

<p class='c012'>Notes drawn in the manner described—made payable
to the order of the signer and endorsed by him—are not
so easily repudiated. In short the burden of proof,
should a contest be made, is not on the holder but on the
maker. When such a note passes into the possession of
a third party the only question about collection is as to
the financial worth of the signer. Under this latter condition
notes of this kind are iron-clad.</p>

<p class='c012'>When suit is brought on a note made to the order of
a physician, and the plea raised of “no value received,”
the holder must prove that full value was given and this
is not always easy to do in cases of medical treatment.
The patient may have been absolutely cured but, if he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>chooses to perjure himself and deny it who is going to
prove the contrary? It will be invariably held that no
one is so competent to judge of improvement, or lack of
improvement, as the patient himself.</p>

<p class='c012'>Law suits are uncertain, expensive and often long
drawn out. Frequently even the winner is a loser. An
easy way to avoid this annoyance and outlay is to have
all notes made in the manner described.</p>

<p class='c012'>Never hold your notes. Always discount them at the
first opportunity. If they are made by men of means
living in the town or county where you practice the local
bankers will be glad to handle them at a fair rate of discount.</p>

<p class='c012'>There is a specialist living in Chicago who occasionally
makes professional trips into other states. On these
trips he frequently has occasion to take a number of
notes. His patients are mostly farmers, and these
rarely carry cash. Just before leaving a town he will
go to the local banker and introduce himself, saying:</p>

<p class='c012'>“I’ve been doing a little business in the neighborhood
and, contrary to my usual custom, have taken part of
my fees in the form of notes. If you have a few
moments to spare I would be thankful for your opinion
as to their worth.”</p>

<p class='c012'>He does not ask to have them discounted; does not
try to dispose of them. The banker looks them over and
comments on each somewhat as follows:</p>

<p class='c012'>“H’m, that’s John Smith. He’s all right; good as
gold. Owns 250 acres of fine land clear, and is prompt
pay.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Thomas Jones. Well, I’m not so sure about Jones.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>He’s good, but he’s slow, and will stand you off if he
can.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Thus he goes through the lot, commenting on the
financial means and willingness to pay of each signer.
When he has concluded the doctor gathers up the notes,
replaces them in his wallet, chats for a moment about
the weather and crop conditions, gives the banker a fine
cigar, thanks him heartily for his courtesy, and turns to
leave.</p>

<p class='c012'>Country bankers make the most, if not all of their
money by discounting the notes of their neighborhood
farmers. They know the financial record of everybody
within reaching distance. Men who are notoriously hard
to collect from when the creditor is a stranger will pay
the local banker without a murmur. They don’t want
to “get in bad” with him because they want a good
credit when they have occasion to borrow money. The
result is that the local banker can collect in full on notes
which in the hands of other holders would be worthless.
They dislike to see notes made by their neighbors leave
their bank. Almost invariably the banker will say:</p>

<p class='c012'>“What are you going to do with that paper, Doctor?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Take it back to Chicago, and hold it until it is due,
I suppose,” replies the doctor. “I don’t know what else
to do with it.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I’ll discount some of it for you, if you wish.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Well, I wouldn’t mind selling it if I don’t have to
pay too much of a share.” (This in an indifferent manner,
as if he didn’t care whether he sold the notes or
kept them.)</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>“Let me see them again,” the banker will say, ninety-nine
times out of a hundred.</p>

<p class='c012'>The doctor hands them over, and the banker sorts out
some of the best, remarking, “I’ll take this lot at 8 per
cent.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, no. I don’t care to dispose of them in that way.
It’s a case of all or none. I might better take a chance
on them all than to have the best culled out.”</p>

<p class='c012'>It usually ends in the banker taking the entire lot at
10 per cent. He will collect every dollar on them, and
the doctor has got rid of a lot of paper on which he
would have hard work in getting half of its face value.
This plan seldom fails when carried out in the right
way.</p>

<p class='c012'>There is one class of notes on which the signers rarely
make a contest. These are the ones given in payment
for sexual treatment. A physician is, as a rule, safe in
taking a note under these conditions as he can usually
collect the full amount. Men are delicate about this
trouble and don’t want their friends and neighbors to
know what they have been treated for. To resist payment
means a law suit in which the physician will go on
the stand and, under the questioning of his attorney,
bring out the fact that John Jones, the maker of the
note, gave it in payment of treatment for prostratitis, or
some other sexual ailment. Pressed for details he lays
bare the whole facts of the case to the intense mortification
of Jones.</p>

<p class='c012'>The doctor, of course, could decline to answer such
questions on the ground that it would be a violation of
the confidence existing between a physician and his patient,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>but he doesn’t want to do so. He’s there to collect
that note, and in furtherance of this purpose he has
posted his attorney in advance as to the questions to be
asked.</p>

<p class='c012'>Most men of sense know this and will pay their notes,
regardless of whether they have been helped or not,
rather than submit to the humiliation which they know
will be heaped on them when the doctor takes the stand.</p>

<p class='c012'>The hardest notes to collect are those given in payment
for the treatment of ailments other than sexual disorders.
But even these, if made out in the manner outlined
in the opening part of this chapter, can be realized
on in full. Suppose a man living in Iowa gives a note
of this kind to a Chicago physician. The latter discounts
it immediately at his local bank which takes it, not because
the maker is known, but on account of the doctor’s
endorsement. Just before maturity the note is forwarded
to the maker’s local bank for collection. The
local banker notifies the maker that it holds the note,
which will be due on such a day. What does the maker
do? Why, he antes, of course. The note is in the hands
of his local banker, a person with whom he is anxious
to preserve his credit. In such a case, with the note
drawn to the order of the signer and endorsed by him,
there can be no plea of “no value received.” Besides,
the obligation is in the hands of an innocent holder before
maturity.</p>

<p class='c012'>Beware of collection agents who want to take your
claims on a percentage commission. Most of them will
deal with you honestly at first on small accounts, and
then get away with the entire proceeds of a big claim.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>A few years ago a Chicago physician gave a number of
ordinary bills to a local collection agency for which he
was to receive the amount of the collections less 25 per
cent., the agency to stand all costs. The agency did
good work, made satisfactory settlements, and finally
the doctor gave them a note for $700 which he held
against a man in another state. It was to be collected
on the same basis—25 per cent. After several months
of delay the agency advised the doctor that a compromise
could be made at $400. The doctor authorized its
acceptance. More months rolled by, and, being unable
to get word of any kind from the agency, the doctor
wrote direct to the local banker in the town where the
maker of the note lived. The banker replied, saying that
the note had been paid in full ($700 and interest) several
months before, and it was then in his possession cancelled.</p>

<p class='c012'>Since then this physician has had his own collector,
under bond from a guarantee company, and gets whatever
money may be taken in by him. It is possible that
the physician might have prosecuted the agency, but
here again he would have been in a dilemma. If he
brought a criminal action it would not get him any
money, and if he proceeded civilly the members of the
agency were execution proof—they had nothing which
could be levied upon. In either event, in order to prove
payment, he would have to bring the banker here at his
own expense—provided he was willing to come—so he
concluded to drop the matter and accept it as a costly
lesson.</p>

  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER XIII<br /> <br /><b>PRESCRIBING OF REMEDIES</b></h2>
</div>
<p class='c011'>The time will come when the physician who has not
made an arrangement with some pharmacist for a division
of the prescription fees, will be obliged to resort to
old-time methods and dispense his own remedies. He
will have to do this, or go out of business—excuse me, I
meant give up practice. It’s high treason, unethical, to
speak of a doctor as being in business, but there’s no
good reason for it. Anything that a man makes a living
at is a business, and if the doctor cannot make a living,
and something more, why he’s in the wrong rut.</p>

<p class='c012'>Barring the division arrangement referred to there are
three things opposed to the physician’s interest which
the druggist must do, or give up his store. These are:</p>

<p class='c012'>1.—Sell patent medicines.</p>

<p class='c012'>2.—Prescribe over the counter.</p>

<p class='c012'>3.—Charge exorbitantly for the medicines prescribed.</p>

<p class='c012'>There is nothing in all this that is illegal, but it is
opposed to the best interests of the profession. At first
sight it appears an evidence of imbecility to send prescriptions
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>to be compounded by a competitor. Yet you
send them to the druggist, who is your most active competitor.
Not only is he one directly, but he is often the
agent of some other doctor or doctors whose merits he
glibly contracts with your demerits, for the edification
of the patient. You tell him, time and again, not to
repeat your prescriptions, but to no purpose. In some
cases you know that he is giving commissions to one set
of doctors, while his clerks are getting commissions
from practice sent to others, yet you stick to him.</p>

<p class='c012'>Now, there’s but one solution of the problem. Every
doctor who can should dispense his own medicines. The
people like it, and the profession will soon learn to like
it. The doctor can furnish medicines cheaply and still
make a profit. The patient pays a bill for services and
medicines much more cheerfully than one for services
alone.</p>

<p class='c012'>Not the least of the good things that would result
from the doctor doing his own dispensing would be the
familiarity with his working tools thus acquired. Most
men enter practice without the least knowledge of the
physical qualities of the drugs they expect to use. Many
a man has prescribed, over and over again, remedies he
never saw, smelt or tasted. The best doctor is he who
is most familiar with his curative agents. Another desirable
result would be the doctor’s renunciation of
polypharmacy. He would soon learn that the number
of serviceable drugs is by no means legion. Where a
number of doctors occupy an office, they should have
their own dispensary.</p>

<p class='c012'>When neither plan suggested is feasible, the doctor
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>should endeavor to find a druggist who, in consideration
of having practically a monopoly of the prescriptions of
that particular physician, will dispense his prescriptions
on cipher and never without an order. It is possible to
find such druggists. Self-interest is likely to induce
them to treat the doctor fairly, when all other arguments
fail. There is a peculiar advantage in this system
in the fact that the doctors’ favorite formulæ can be kept
in quantities already prepared, thus saving time and
assuring uniformity in dispensing. Under such an
arrangement, too, the druggist is able to be much more
reasonable in his prices. He is also likely to keep such
special preparations as the doctor may request, thus
avoiding the temptation to substitute.</p>

<p class='c012'>One thing is certain in the relations of doctor and
druggist, viz., the time is not far distant when the
doctor will either dispense his own drugs or will boycott
every druggist who counter-prescribes or sells patent
medicines. The profession will not go blindly on forever,
carrying grist to the other fellow’s mill.</p>

<p class='c012'>Next we must contend with the proprietary medicine
fakir. The doctor’s experience often breeds a lack of
confidence in his remedies, and his materia medica narrows
year by year. Yet his patients clamor for relief,
and in despair the doctor receives, with open arms, the
fakir who agrees to furnish him with speedy cures.</p>

<p class='c012'>Behold the result. The pharmacopeia is fast drifting
into the valley of dead lumber. It is no longer necessary
to know anything of materia medica and therapeutics—the
fakir attends to all that for us. We are no
longer offended by the gratuitous insult offered us by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>the proprietary medicine fiend, who knocks at our door,
and, with the implied insinuation that he furnishes
brains for the medical profession, clutters our office
tables up with samples, the labels on which tell us all
about diseases and the only preparations that will cure
them. Pah! How most of them smell! And what a
nuisance they are.</p>

<p class='c012'>But the fakir has done his work well. He has evolved
the ready-made doctor—man of all work, aye, slave to
the fakir. How gently flows the current of Dr. Readymade’s
professional life. No more incurable cases.
No more midnight oil—for why should he be a slave of
the lamp? No more worry. No more care. No more
expenditures for books, journals and instruments. All
the doctor has to do nowadays is to read the labels on
the bottles and boxes of samples the fakir brings him.
Does the patient complain of stomach disturbance? He
is given “Stomachine.” Are his kidneys working overtime?
“Kidneyol” is the proper caper. Is there a pain
lurking somewhere in his economy? Give him one of
these pretty little tablets with a hieroglyph on it, which
nobody knows the composition of—so the firm that
makes them claims. Oh, the practice of medicine is so
easy nowadays. Ready-made diagnosis and treatment—what
could be simpler?</p>

<p class='c012'>The proprietary medicine fakir begins his little song
by assuring the physician that his wonderful preparation
is for the use of the profession only. He is trying to introduce
it “along strictly ethical lines.” He has given
the preparation a fanciful name and marked it with a
special design “for the protection of the physician, who,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>of course, wants to know that his patient gets just what
is ordered.” What an imbecile the doctor is. The chief
objects of the special name and hieroglyphic design are:</p>

<p class='c012'>(1) To induce the physician to order the preparation
frequently, the name being catchy and easy to remember.</p>

<p class='c012'>(2) To let the patient know what is ordered, so that
he can prescribe it for himself and friends without the
aid of a doctor.</p>

<p class='c012'>Having popularized the preparation in this manner,
the proprietary medicine man often advertises his wares
directly to the public via the secular press. If the profession
protests, the wily medicine man says: “Well,
you indorsed it; the profession uses it; hence it is a
good preparation and a benefit to humanity. Go to, you
are bigoted and narrow-minded.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Now, brethren, while the foregoing remarks are fresh
in your minds, try and recall the facts regarding “Scott’s
Emulsion” and the “Midy Capsule.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Not all proprietary medicine men take the newspaper
route—they don’t have to. The catspaw doctor does his
work too well. Witness the “little joker” anti-pain tablet
already mentioned. Probably ten times as much of
this preparation is self-prescribed as is prescribed by
physicians. It unquestionably contains drugs that
should be taken only under medical advice, and yet
physicians prescribe it in a manner which leads directly
to self-prescribing by the laity. Is it possible that the
Pharmacopeia offers no agent of equal or better merit?
Has the manufacturer more wisdom than all the ages
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>past—to say nothing of the present age of progress? Or
is this an age of medical progress, anyway?</p>

<p class='c012'>We herewith submit the proposition that the medical
catspaw is pulling the proprietary monkey’s chestnuts
out of the fire, every time he prescribes a proprietary
article “protected” by special design and under a term
that he who runs may read. The fakir laughs in his
sleeve at the profession, and small wonder. It has come
to pass that he owns us, and when his impudent agent
demands a hearing at our offices we are tacitly given to
understand that our time is his by right. Perhaps it is,
by right of conquest, for the medical profession seems to
be thoroughly subjugated. The distributor of drug
samples is always working in the business interests of
his firm and himself. How would it do to insist on payment
for our time from the agents of some of our irresponsible,
mushroom fake medicine factories?</p>

<p class='c012'>There is another side to the picture. Drug manufacturers—even
some of those engaged in the manufacture
of quasi-proprietary medicines—have done much for
pharmaceutic elegance and convenience. Many of our
manufacturers are conscientiously proceeding along
ethical lines. We are glad to welcome their representatives
and their preparations. But, unfortunately, such
manufacturers are a small minority. The physician
should be careful how he prescribes the preparations of
even reliable firms. Preparations with special and striking
names should be prescribed under formula, where
possible, and always in such a manner that the patient
cannot prescribe the preparation for himself offhand.</p>

<p class='c012'>We have much for which to thank some of our manufacturers,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>in the way of elegant and reliable preparations—honor
to whom honor is due. We should none the
less, however, guard our own interests. The manufacturers
cannot always do so, and sometimes will not.
There is no objection to secret methods of preparation
of medicine so long as the formula is known. The physician
should know what he is prescribing. It is an
insult to offer him any other class of preparations.
When prescribing he should prescribe under a term
comprehending the formula of the drug, or under his
own cipher. Where the nature of the preparation is
such that he cannot do this, the doctor had better look
elsewhere for a remedy.</p>

<p class='c012'>Again we say, if you cannot make a satisfactory division
arrangement with a competent pharmacist who will
protect your prescriptions, and treat them as confidential,
dispense your own remedies.</p>

<p class='c012'>Never prescribe a proprietary remedy by its trade
name. In so doing you advise the patient of what he is
taking and in time he will buy it without your prescription
or advice. If you are satisfied that the preparation
is a good one and really has medicinal merit—which a
few of them do—prescribe it, if you must, by formula.
Don’t let the patient know what you are giving him.</p>

<p class='c012'>The money in the practice of medicine is in mystery.
People don’t attach much importance or value to things
that they know. It is the mysterious that commands
their attention—and money. Let a man know that you
are giving him a certain proprietary preparation and he
values it only at the established market price. Give him
the same ingredients in the form of a regular prescription,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>each item written out in its Latin name with the
proper hieroglyphics for quantities, and he will rate you
as a wonder worker. Add “aqua, quant. suf.,” and he is
knocked daffy.</p>

<p class='c012'>It’s simply another form of that peculiar trait of
human nature which leads the average man to “kick”
when his regular family physician charges $5 for making
a ten-mile call on a stormy night, when he will travel
the ten miles himself and cheerfully pay a specialist $25
for ten minutes’ consultation in the latter’s office.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>
  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER XIV<br /> <br /><b>CORPORATION DOCTORS</b></h2>
</div>
<p class='c011'>Of recent years many corporations, especially the
large manufacturing and railway concerns, have made it
part of their policy to employ doctors on contract. At
first such jobs paid fairly well. It was to the interest of
the corporations to engage men of reputation and they
had to pay them. It sounded well, it created a favorable
impression, to have it known that the United States
Steel Corporation had engaged the celebrated Dr. Curem
to attend to such of its employees as might become sick
or disabled while in service.</p>

<p class='c012'>Truly, a generous corporation, the public would
argue. It not only looks after its sick and injured without
charge to the unfortunate, but it gives them the
benefit of the best medical and surgical talent obtainable.
But the corporations did not do this from philanthropic
motives. Not much. It was a matter of business.</p>

<p class='c012'>Sickness and accident among a large force of employees
costs money. The quicker it can be overcome the
better off the company will be. But, the reputation for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>philanthropy once established, the corporations began to
economize in their outlay for medical expenses. For
this the doctors and surgeons were largely at fault themselves.
The plum was too tempting and there was a
keen competition for it, with the result that prices took
a sharp tumble.</p>

<p class='c012'>Physicians with a small practice who heard of other
doctors getting $5,000 a year to look after the sick and
injured employees of a corporation argued that they
would like to do the work for $2,000. It would ensure
living expenses, and what they could pick up on the side
in regular practice would be profit. They didn’t know,
until too late that the demands on their time would be
such that they would have little opportunity for outside
practice, and that the $2,000 they received from the corporation
would cover their entire income. So they began
bidding and wire-pulling against one another, and
the corporations, wise unto their day and generation,
took advantage of the unseemly competition.</p>

<p class='c012'>In no one line of corporate endeavor is this competition
more keen and noticeable than in life insurance. It
is not so very long ago that the position of medical examiner
for a good company was a respectable, lucrative
position. What is it now? It is safe to say that there
is hardly a company in the field to-day that pays a
decent sum for its medical examinations. The doctor is
the watchdog of the company’s treasury. He stands between
it and great financial loss. He protects it against
fraud. A slight error or the least degree of negligence
on his part may cost the company thousands and thousands
of dollars. The issuance of a policy is a very important
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>business transaction. The doctor stands in the
same relation to it as does the lawyer who examines the
abstract in a real estate deal. Contrast the fee allowed
the medical examiner in a case involving the issuance of
a $100,000 life insurance policy and that received by the
lawyer who examines the abstract in a real estate transfer
involving $5,000, and my argument is complete.
Some companies expect to secure all of an expert examiner’s
time—and actually get it—for $2,000 to $3,000 a
year. It might be well to contrast, also, the commission
received by the agent who writes the policy, with the
medical examiner’s fee.</p>

<p class='c012'>In the case of our fraternal societies the examiner’s
fees are pitifully low, so low that a busy man cannot do
the work save at a great loss of time. There are some
extenuating circumstances in the case of the co-operative
societies. In the case of both old line and co-operative
insurance, however, only the overcrowded and generally
poverty-stricken condition of the medical profession can
possibly explain the fact that good men are to be had so
cheaply.</p>

<p class='c012'>Railroad and manufacturing corporations have no
difficulty in securing doctors to look after their interests
at a rate so low as to reflect on the respectability of the
profession at large. There are, for example, instances
in which doctors are rendering for $300 a year services
that should bring several thousand dollars at very ordinary
fees. In addition to this direct cheapening of professional
values, the company or corporation surgeon is
expected to go on the stand as an expert and prevaricate
in the interests of his employers. As a corollary, he is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>expected to testify against the interests of the poor
fellow who, perhaps, as the result of the company’s wilful
neglect, has only the wreck of a once vigorous manhood
with which to oppose the company’s immense
capital. And this the doctor does in an uncomfortable
proportion of cases.</p>

<p class='c012'>When the charge is made that he “prevaricates” it is
correct. It would be pitiful, indeed, if the expert opinions
rendered by some corporation doctors were the
result of ignorance. The corporation expert does not
always prevaricate. The truth may be the best card to
play. He had better not let the corporation catch him
telling the truth, however, when said truth is prejudicial
to its interests. There is an ax, my brethren, an ax that
is ever ready.</p>

<p class='c012'>Speaking of corporation surgeons reminds me of the
fact that practice in the neighborhood of our large factories
is rather poor picking for everybody. There is
plenty of work to be done, and there would be considerable
income derived therefrom, but the corporation
surgeon gets it all, and receives a mere pittance therefor.
The corporation claims to employ a surgeon for humanity’s
sake. This is pure hypocrisy—the doctor is employed
for its own protection. Every doctor knows of
cases in which, by the co-operation of the claim agent
and the surgeon, an injured employee has been induced
to sign away his manifest rights. He is usually denied
the right to select his own surgeon. To the non-partisan
medical observer, the bitter opposition of the average
juryman to corporations is in no wise remarkable. It
will be argued that there are plenty of honest corporation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>doctors. Grant you that, but it is hard to see how
they hold their jobs.</p>

<p class='c012'>Then there is a hurtful disposition to fraternize. In
the good old days the regular profession ostracized him
who consulted with that horrid bugaboo, the homeopath.
It has come to pass that the regular lion has laid
him down beside the homeopathic lamb. And when
they rise again the mutton shall be no more, and the lion
shall have waxed fat. The latter-day regular has gone
farther, and hobnobbed, as on equal terms, with “osteopaths,”
“Christian Scientists,” “faith healers,” and others
of their ilk. Not so? Oh, yes it is. It is not long since
the Physicians’ Club of Chicago invited representatives
of these creeds to break bread with it, and formally discuss
the merits and demerits of their theories as opposed
to regular medicine. The affair was given great publicity
in the newspapers, and the wise layman, reading
thereof, laughed exceedingly merry and said, “What
fools these doctors be.”</p>

<p class='c012'>And, from a business, politic and social standpoint, were
they really so very clever? The Physicians’ Club gave
these people standing in the public eye, and by inviting
them to a joint discussion, gave them professional recognition—a
recognition they were not slow to use as a
valuable advertisement. If a dinner invitation does not
constitute social recognition, what does? This action of
the Physicians’ Club did more to further the interests
of these people than they themselves could have done in
a year. Still, mistakes will happen, and the worst that
can be said of the club is that it made a serious, impolitic
and unbusiness-like blunder.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>It is much easier to direct attention to faults than it
is to suggest remedies therefor. In most of the points
here made, the remedy suggests itself. In general, the
remedy lies in an improvement of professional <i>esprit
de corps</i>. With a betterment of this as a foundation,
much can be done to improve the business aspect of
medicine in its higher sense. The time will come when
professional co-operation in the broadest sense will be
absolutely necessary if we would survive.</p>

<p class='c012'>A little of the proper spirit of trades unionism might
not be a bad thing. So far as the strictly financial aspect
of legitimate practice is concerned, the sooner we impress
the public with the idea that we appreciate our
own market value and insist on its appreciation by the
public, the better it will be for the profession. Once let
it be understood that ours is a business-like and financially
sound profession, and the <i>hoi polloi</i> will give us
the respect that is our due. The public should have frequent
and pointed reminders that there is more than a
philanthropic side to our labors. The doctor’s wife and
children deserve quite as much consideration as the layman’s.</p>

  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER XV<br /> <br /><b>MEDICAL “STEERERS” AND THEIR WORK</b></h2>
</div>
<p class='c011'>Every doctor has his steerers, people who drum up
business for him. In many instances it is a service willingly
performed out of real affection and confidence in
the skill and ability of the physician. The latter is unconscious
of any such influence being exerted in his
behalf until he is told by some new patient, “I was advised
to come to you by Mr. ——, who says you are the
only man who ever did him any good.” This is “steering,”
legitimate, unpaid-for steering. The doctor is, of
course, grateful to Mr. ——, or ought to be, but it is
seldom that he gives the matter a second thought.</p>

<p class='c012'>Then there is another kind of “steering,” the cold,
commercial variety in which the labors of the steerer,
if they are successful, are rewarded in coin of the realm.
Nearly every advertising physician—and some who do
not advertise—has one or more of the genus “steerer”
on his staff.</p>

<p class='c012'>There is just as much caste, just as pronounced a
social distinction in this calling as there is in the medical
profession itself. The cheap doctor has cheap, rough
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>steerers; the doctor who is higher up in the social scale
has smooth diplomats in his employ. The object of all
is the same—to get business for their employer, and the
more business they get the larger are their incomes.</p>

<p class='c012'>There are some steerers who think themselves well
repaid if they are handed a dollar for each patient they
land in the office of the physician who employs them.
These are the men who can approach only a cheap class
of people to whom a five dollar fee is the limit.</p>

<p class='c012'>The better class of steerers, the men who work for the
big fee getters, scorn a salary, or a stated amount for
each patient. They prefer a percentage, usually one-quarter
of the fee secured from the patient. There are
men in Chicago who are making $150 a week in this
occupation.</p>

<p class='c012'>Go into the rotunda of any first-class hotel in Chicago,
New York, or some other large city and affect to walk
lame as if afflicted with locomotor ataxia, or make up to
resemble a confirmed invalid. It will not be long before
you will be approached by some well-dressed, prosperous-looking
individual who will say:</p>

<p class='c012'>“Beg pardon, sir, but you appear to be suffering from
locomotor ataxia. You will excuse me for addressing
you, but I was afflicted in the same way myself for ten
years, and have a sympathetic feeling for fellow sufferers.”</p>

<p class='c012'>If you are a genuine sufferer this will command your
attention. Here is a robust, healthy man who tells you
that for ten years he was afflicted with the same ailment
which you have been assured by many physicians
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>is incurable. Naturally you want to know how the disease
was overcome. The stranger smiles, and says:</p>

<p class='c012'>“Why the thing is so easy it sounds ridiculous, and I
dislike to tell of it on that account. For eight years I
doctored, and spent a large amount of money, without
obtaining the slightest relief. About two years ago I
read in a magazine of a new treatment with which wonderful
results were being accomplished. After so many
failures I naturally didn’t have much faith, but things
couldn’t be any worse so I decided to investigate. What
I learned led me to take the treatment. There was an
improvement after the first week, and at the end of the
sixth month I was just as sound as I am to-day. That
was eighteen months ago, and there are no signs of a
reaction of any kind.”</p>

<p class='c012'>By this time the real sufferer is deeply impressed.
Here is a prosperous stranger, once a fellow sufferer,
dangling before his eyes the hope, nay, the certainty, of
cure, with no other object than that of sympathy. It is
the one chance for which he has been so long and fruitlessly
seeking.</p>

<p class='c012'>Pressed to tell where this wonderful treatment may
be had, the “steerer,” if he is one of the sharp ones, will
be apt to say:</p>

<p class='c012'>“I believe the address is No. —— Michigan Avenue.
Let’s see, I think I have the doctor’s card in my pocket
somewhere.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Meantime he searches through various pockets (knowing
full well all the time where it is) and finally locates
the doctor’s card.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>“Ah, yes, here it is. ‘Dr. ——, —— Michigan
Avenue.’”</p>

<p class='c012'>Adroitly he changes the topic at this point, shifting to
the various features of the disease itself, its excruciating
pains, the cushion-soled feet, loss of various bodily functions,
and other unfailing accompaniments of the ailment.
Comparing notes the two find that they have suffered
much in the same way (all ataxia patients do) and
from that moment there is a strong bond of fellowship
between them.</p>

<p class='c012'>The smooth steerer tells of the various treatments he
had taken at great cost and without results, glibly describes
the many drugs swallowed, and the tortures endured
with mechanical appliances, such as the “hanging”
process, winding up with “but not one of them did a bit
of good until I took up the —— —— treatment.”</p>

<p class='c012'>The actual sufferer has met a congenial spirit, and
talks freely. Without realizing it he tells of his business
affairs, his financial condition, and similar matters.
During all this the steerer makes no suggestion that he
should call on Dr. ——. Far from it. He studiously
avoids anything of the kind. The bait has been cast and
the fish will rise to it of his own accord. Having secured
all the information he wants the “steerer” will rise
and excuse himself on the ground of an important business
engagement. Handing out a neatly engraved card
he says:</p>

<p class='c012'>“If you ever come to New York, Mr. ——, I would
like to have you hunt me up. I’d stay longer with you
this afternoon, but for this pressing engagement.”</p>

<p class='c012'>The card reads about like this:</p>
<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>&nbsp;</p>
<div class='box'>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c005'>
    <div><span class='small'>MR. G. ADDINGTON WELLS</span></div>
    <div class='c000'>1027 Broadway</div>
    <div class='c000'>Structural Iron&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New York City</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>
<p class='c012'>&nbsp;</p>
<p class='c015'>The card is a blind. “G. Addington Wells” is an assumed
name. But it sounds well. Your smooth
“steerer” never pretends to live in the same city in
which he finds his victim. It might be too easy to locate
him in case he was wanted. He lives in Chicago, all
right, but he assumes the role of an Eastern business
man here on business purposes. His appearance, his
general “get up,” his talk is all impressive and calculated
to beget confidence. That’s his business. He’s a fake
all through, even to the nature of the ailment with
which he pretends to have been afflicted. He was never
seriously ill in his life. But he’s a clever fakir; we must
give him credit for that. He’s an artist in his line.</p>

<p class='c012'>There is one man of this kind in Chicago so thoroughly
posted in medicine that he can accurately describe
the symptoms and characteristics of half a dozen
chronic ailments, and in one week has successfully
played the role of having entirely recovered from each.
If he meets a tabetic sufferer he has been successfully
treated for tabes, and will converse intelligently about
tabetic conditions. Chronic arthritis, nephritis, paralysis
agitans, lateral sclerosis; they are all known to this chap.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>He’s had them all—in his mind—when he wants to impress
a sufferer, and he seldom makes a mistake.</p>

<p class='c012'>Almost invariably as the “steerer” is about to leave
the sufferer will say: “If I can stand the trip I’ll go
down and see this Dr. —— this afternoon. How far is
it from here?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Well, it’s quite a journey for a man in your condition,
but I’ll tell you what I’ll do. If you want to go
now you can ride in my cab. I’m going that way and
I’ll drop you out at the doctor’s. He will see that you
get back to the hotel all right.”</p>

<p class='c012'>This suits the sufferer, who is pleased with the attention
shown him by the “steerer.” The latter excuses
himself for a moment while he “telephones for a cab.”
He goes into the telephone booth but, instead of calling
for a cab, he rings up the doctor.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Hello, is this Dr. ——? Yes. This is Wells. Just
landed a good one at the La Salle. Will bring him down
in about twenty minutes. Name is Smith, banker at
Pontiac. Well fixed.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Then he rejoins the sufferer, escorts him carefully to
the sidewalk and places him in a taxicab. The doctor’s
office is not far off, but the chauffeur takes the longest
way, and during the ride the “steerer” tells of having
lived in New York all his life with the exception of the
six months he was under treatment in Chicago, and
dilates upon the wonders of the Eastern metropolis. On
reaching the doctor’s the “steerer” looks at his watch,
saying:</p>

<p class='c012'>“I’ve got ten minutes to spare so I’ll go up to the
doctor’s office with you.”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>The sufferer is glad of this assistance, and when they
reach the office is impressed by the dignified appearance
of the specialist who greets “Wells” warmly.</p>

<p class='c012'>“How do you do, Mr. Wells. I was afraid you had
forgotten me.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, no, Doctor, I couldn’t do that, after all you have
done for me. But, really I can’t stop to talk now. I’ll
see you again before I leave town. Dr. ——, this is Mr.
Smith of Pontiac, who is suffering the same as I was.
If you do as well for him as you did for me I think he
will have reason to be glad he came here. Good day,
gentlemen. Excuse me for my haste, but I must get
away.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Fine man, that Wells,” says the doctor to Mr. Smith,
after the “steerer” has gone.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, indeed,” replies Smith. “Mighty glad I met
him. He has given me a lot of valuable advice and aid.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“One of the toughest cases I ever had,” continues the
doctor, “but I pulled him through all right, and I’m
proud of it.”</p>

<p class='c012'>By this time Mr. Smith is an easy subject to handle.
“Wells” has paved the way, and the doctor does the rest.
Smith pays a good-sized fee, say $1,000, and begins
treatment.</p>

<p class='c012'>Later in the day the “steerer” calls on the doctor again
and gets his bit—$250. Any chance for the doctor to
hold out on him? Not a chance in the world. In the
first place he is too valuable a man to lose and it is to
the doctor’s interest to treat him fairly. Besides this the
“steerer” is in position to protect himself. If he has any
doubts about the size of the fee he will drop in on Mr.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>Smith again at the hotel the same evening “just for a
moment’s chat before I leave the city.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“How did you get along with the doctor, Mr. Smith?”
he will ask.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Very nicely. He seems to be a good man, and apparently
understands his business. But he’s pretty steep
in his fees.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes; he’s a good man, and an A No. 1 physician. As
for fees, all these big specialists charge pretty well, but
we shouldn’t mind that if we get relief. I paid him
$1,000.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“That’s just what he charged me,” says Mr. Smith.</p>

<p class='c012'>After a few moments chat the “steerer” leaves, satisfied
that the doctor has given him the agreed-upon commission.
If, on the other hand, he finds that the doctor
has “held out” on him he hunts him up and remonstrates.
Should this be of no avail the “steerer” severs
business relations with that particular specialist, and
makes a compact with one of his competitors. Good
“steerers” are always in demand and the doctor who
picks up an artist in this line is pretty sure to use him
well so as to make sure of retaining him.</p>

<p class='c012'>It is not every day that the steerer can pick up a
patient that will net him $250. Sometimes his “bit” will
not be more than $12.50 or $25, but it is safe to say that
a smooth man who thoroughly understands the business
can easily average $150 a week. He takes life easy,
dresses well, and lives on the fat of the land. Few
patients after paying a big fee to the doctor feel like
staying at an expensive hotel for any length of time.
Besides this the doctor generally manipulates matters so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>that the patient finds it to his interest to board at some
place recommended by the physician. This clears the
road for the steerer at the hotels and leaves him free to
operate among them without fear of running into any
of his victims. In a city where there are a number of
large hotels it is an easy matter for the steerer to so
regulate his movements as to avoid suspicion by being
seen around any one house too often or continuously.</p>

<p class='c012'>There are women “steerers” also, but they work in a
much different manner from the men. In nearly every
community there are women of business instinct who
are not averse to earning some “easy” money. One of
these women will make an arrangement with Dr.
Sweatem by which she is to receive a commission on all
the patients she may send him. Her commission is not
so large as that given the men steerers because she does
not work among strangers, or personally take such
patients as she may secure to the doctor’s office. Still it
is a handsome sum—generally 10 or 15 per cent of the
fee—enough to give an active, influential woman a very
respectable income.</p>

<p class='c012'>The woman “steerer” makes it her business to join
various clubs and churches, take part in all women
movements, and to get acquainted with as many of her
sex as possible. She especially cultivates the acquaintance
of well-to-do women who are real sufferers, or
imagine themselves to be afflicted in some manner. She
encourages them to talk about their physical troubles,
is kindly sympathetic, and, at the proper moment makes
delicate suggestion that it would be well for the sufferer
to see Dr. Sweatem.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>“He’s such a grand man. Seems to know just what to
do, and has been so successful in treating a lot of my
friends. I wouldn’t think of going to anyone but him
myself.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Thus the seed is sown, and in time bears fruit. The
well-to-do sufferer goes to see Dr. Sweatem and is relieved
of a good fee, if nothing else. The doctor in the
meantime has been advised over the phone by the
woman “steerer” that Mrs. —— is coming to see him,
and informed as to her financial condition, as well as the
nature of the ailment with which she thinks she is
afflicted. Armed with this information he knows just
what to do when Mrs. —— arrives at his office, and the
patient is deeply impressed by the manner in which he
so accurately diagnosed her case at the first interview.</p>

<p class='c012'>Another point of information always conveyed in
advance to the doctor is the age of the prospective caller.
Thus advised, when the interview does take place he is
in position to say:</p>

<p class='c012'>“A woman of your age—let’s see, you’re not over 32,
are you, Mrs. ——? —— ought to,” etc.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, yes, Doctor, I’m 40,” will be the answer.</p>

<p class='c012'>“You surprise me. I would never think it.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Foxy doctor. He knows all the time her exact age
because the “steerer” has told him, but he’s too smooth
to give himself away. And thus he makes another ally,
and easily-duped patient. As for Mrs. ——, she is enthusiastic.
She reports her visit to the “steerer,” saying:</p>

<p class='c012'>“I’m glad you advised me to go. He’s a splendid
doctor; perfectly lovely, and I know he’s going to do me
good.”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>And he does. Not only that, but the chances are that
her enthusiasm will give Dr. Sweatem opportunity to
“do” the patient’s intimate friends and relatives also.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>
  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER XVI<br /> <br /><b>WHAT SHOULD THE PHYSICIAN DO?</b></h2>
</div>
<p class='c011'>All this leads up to the question “What is the young
physician to do?” The majority of them can remain
strictly ethical and drag out a miserable existence, so
far as getting a livelihood from the practice of their profession
is concerned, because they never should have
studied medicine in the first place. Those who are
equipped by nature and education for successful practice,
may gain a competence by imitating some of their
elders (those who howl the loudest about violation of
ethics) and throw down the bars. Just how far they
may graze in the non-ethical pasture is a matter for each
practitioner to judge for himself.</p>

<p class='c012'>According to the <i>Journal of the American Medical
Association</i>, the organ of the strictly ethical cult, there
are 140 “acceptable” medical colleges in the United
States, turning out on an average of 5,000 young doctors
annually, to say nothing of those graduated from other
schools. The census of 1900 gave the number of physicians
in the United States, including Alaska and
Hawaii, as 132,439, an average of one to each 122.5 families.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>But these are not distributed pro rata. Naturally
the doctors are most numerous in the thickly settled
parts of the country. Hawaii has one physician to every
1,412 persons, and Utah one to every 907. The ratio in
the entire United States is one to every 575.7 people. In
the District of Columbia, however, which is virtually
co-extensive with the limits of the city of Washington,
so far as population is concerned, official figures show
one doctor to every 297 residents. Chicago, with a population
of 2,185,283 people, has 4,432 doctors, one to each
515 people.</p>

<p class='c012'>The plain fact is that the medical schools are grinding
out alleged “doctors” too fast, and without proper regard
for individual qualifications. But there is some sign of
improvement. The better class of colleges, notably
Rush Medical and the College of Physicians and Surgeons,
have called a halt, and are insisting upon a higher
grade of attainments for admission, and upon a more
thorough and searching examination at graduation time.
Last year the College of Physicians and Surgeons alone
turned away 150 applicants as not being fitted for a
medical career. This new system has had the effect of
greatly reducing the number of candidates for medical
diplomas. In 1900–1901 Rush Medical had 1,055 students
on its rolls; in 1909–1910 the number was only 584. The
decrease at the College of Physicians and Surgeons,
while not so marked, was still a healthy one. In 1900–1901
this college had 676 students; in 1909–1910 the
number had dropped to 529.</p>

<p class='c012'>But, despite this reduction, the number graduated
every year is still much too large. There are at least
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>2,000 alleged “doctors” turned loose every year whose
medical services could well be dispensed with—with
profit to themselves, and more safety to the community.
Taking the average of one physician to every 122.5 families
it follows that, in order for each doctor to earn the
modest income of $2,000 a year each family must contribute
$16.31 in fees every year. This is preposterous.</p>

<p class='c012'>Again we are brought face to face with the question,
“What is the young physician going to do?” As said
before, he can kick down the bars of the ethical field and
emancipate himself, if he has brains, courage, and a winning
address. Or, he may assist in the formation of a
sort of labor union for the maintenance of fees and the
black-listing of dead beats. This latter course, however,
is not likely to prove effective, as there are too many
needy ones in the profession ready to remain outside of
such a union and grab what they can.</p>

<p class='c012'>Dr. W. A. Evans, commissioner of health for the city
of Chicago and for twenty years in touch with the medical
profession, says that hundreds of physicians in
Chicago are virtually without means to support their
families. What a man situated like this often does do
in the circumstances may work disaster even upon the
general public. He may help put the records of the
health department to the bad. Here is an example in
point.</p>

<p class='c012'>“A young doctor is called into a family which lives in
the rear of a man’s place of business, above the store or
next door to it. The competent young physician discovers
a patient suffering from diphtheria, scarlet fever,
maybe smallpox. The law requires the posting of placards
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>and the isolation of these victims of contagious
diseases. But at once the family in such close connection
with the place of business recognizes what such a
placard may mean to the business by which the family
of the patient lives.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Will you imagine the pressure that may be brought
to bear on this physician whose own family is so dependent
upon him? Isn’t it reasonable that with sufficient
compensation offered him he is likely to cover up
the infectious case? Or if the family has not thought of
offering the inducement, the young doctor himself may
propose it and ask the limit of compensation.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Educated, brainy physicians of high standing, are beginning
to balk at some of the ethical commandments
which bar the way to a doctor’s increasing his income.
When Dr. Oscar A. King was asked what he thought
about the division of fees, he said:</p>

<p class='c012'>“Why not? The physician who has diagnosed the
trouble and finds that an operation is necessary may have
paid only two or three visits to the patient at $2 or $3 a
visit. The result is that, honestly, he must give his patient
over to a surgeon. ‘What surgeon?’ is asked most
frequently by the patient. Honestly the doctor names a
man who has taken many cases from him and most successfully.
But where the physician gets $8 or $10, the
surgeon may get $150, $300, or $500. And—except for
the physician—the surgeon never would have heard of
the patient.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“It’s all fair enough if openly above board,” said Dr.
Evans, in reply to the same question. “It would be a
most logical thing in business, only that the public is not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>prepared to compare business with the professions of
medicine and surgery. When it comes home that both
doctor and surgeon must be assured of a living, however,
the fact is a jar to the purely ethical.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Another physician said: “I have just had an experience
along the line of the split fee. An old doctor friend
of mine discovered the presence of gall stones in his patient.
It is a difficult thing to diagnose with certainty.
My friend, however, made no mistake and received $25
from the wealthy patient. The surgeon who operated in
the comparatively simple case got a fee of $500. It
would have been only fair for the physician to have received
part of that $500 fee, and I think he was a chump
if he did not get it.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“But you can’t put a profession on a business basis,”
shriek the high moguls of ethics. Why not? On this subject
Prof. George Burman Foster, of the University of
Chicago, speaks plainly, as follows:</p>

<p class='c012'>“What is the difference between a profession and a
business? Is it, as was once thought, that the former is
fulfilled by the mind and the latter by the body? But,
for example, dentistry is quite manual and engineering
or carpentry quite mental as well. Besides, the old idea
of a dualism between mind and body is no longer held
by the modern man. Then is the difference that the profession
is ‘learned’ but the business is not?</p>

<p class='c012'>“But we have men who are not college graduates entering
the professions, while business of a higher order
is clamoring for college graduates. Besides, we have
changed our notion of what constitutes ‘learning’ and
concluded that the man who by experience has learned
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>‘life’ may know quite as much as the man who has
learned books in the school. But is the difference, then,
that the professional man receives a special professional
training, while the business man does not? But farmers
are going to agricultural schools, while the majority of
preachers still do not go to a theological school!</p>

<p class='c012'>“Shall we say that the professional man is distinguished
by eminent character and ability, while the business man
is not? Hardly. We know that while the business principle
is pagan and not Christian to-day, still the average
business man is quite as good as the average professional
man, no matter what the profession may be.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Who deserves more honor—the farmer who provides
us with our daily bread, or the dentist who keeps our
teeth so that we can eat it, or the physician our stomach
so that we can digest it?</p>

<p class='c012'>“The best sign of our time is the growing sense of the
worth of the profane, of the secular, and a growing depreciation
of what once was called ‘sacred’ and ‘holy.’
To be sure, of the professions the ‘clerical’ is still
regarded as ‘sacred;’ but since the religion of the future
is to be a secular religion, the ‘sacredness’ of the ministerial
office will in time pass away.</p>

<p class='c012'>“The students in our schools to-day are taught this.
They see that the distinction between profession and
business is at last only traditional. They are bent on
fulfilling the task which is in accord with the incentive
and legislation of their special natures and characters.
They know of something above the old honor of the profession
and the new money of the business—namely:
